For ten thousand years, they were humanity's shield against the darkness, the Emperor's finest warriors. Now, the last space marine lies dead on the black sands of Antiloch Prime. No more gene seed, no more chapters, no more angels of death. The Imperium's greatest weapon is gone forever, and every enemy of mankind knows it. I still remember the wind on Antelok Prime. Black sand carried on currents of bitter air that scraped flesh raw and wore ceramite to nothing. The augurs called it corrosive, a chemical peculiarity in the atmosphere. But we who stood upon those obsidian shores knew better. It was hatred given form, the planet itself rejecting us, as if even this dead rock at the edge of the Imperium knew what was coming. i am lord militant varroquest commander of the seventh imperial crusade keeper of the emperor's will across six hundred worlds my authority once extended from the gothic sector to the fringes of ultramar Now I command ghosts and rumors, leading armies that exist primarily on parchment. The grand battalions of my youth have withered to skeleton companies, our proud regiments reduced to hollow formations of exhausted men marching beneath tattered banners. Twenty-seven standard years I have carried the warrant of the High Lords. Twenty-seven years spent watching as our borders contract, as the void between imperial worlds grows wider and the enemies of mankind grow bolder. We were never meant to fight alone. That was the truth no one spoke aloud. The Imperial Guard, the Navy, the Ecclesiarchy, we were all designed to fight alongside them. The Angels, the Space Marines. We knew they were dying. We had known for centuries, but we believed there would always be some. A handful of chapters standing sentinel over our most precious worlds. The gradual thinning of their ranks was a strategic reality, not an existential threat. Even I believed this. Until that day on Antiloch Prime, they brought him in a stasis capsule, floating in amniotic fluid, the color of old blood. Chapter Master Constantine of the Iron Sentinels. The last of his kind. His gene seed had been deteriorating for generations, each implantation less successful than the last. The final batch had simply dissolved into toxic sludge. The chapter apothecaries had spent decades trying to stabilize the corruption to find some viable strand of the emperor's gift that could be preserved. They failed. Constantine was 907 years old. His body had been rebuilt 17 times. More machine than man, more legend than flesh. The capsule made a soft humming sound as the tech priests monitored his fading life signs. I remember standing before it in the command bunker, my officers arranged in a silent semicircle behind me. No one spoke. What was there to say? We were witnessing the end of an era, the final death of a legacy ten thousand years old. I placed my hand against the glass. It was warm. Constantine opened his eyes. Ancient eyes the color of gunmetal set in a face carved from scar tissue and augmetics. He looked at me and I saw recognition there. He knew what his death meant. His voice came through the Vox grill mounted on the capsule. distorted and mechanical but unmistakably his, the voice that had commanded imperial forces across three sectors, the voice that had pronounced judgment on heretics and Xenos alike. He said one word, just one, endure. Then the biomonitors flatlined. The tech priests moved forward, muttering rites of passage. I ordered them away. This moment belonged to us, the mortals who would have to carry on without our angels. My officers and I stood vigil as Constantine's body was prepared for internment. The last space marine. The end of the Emperor's finest creation. We burned his body according to the traditions of his chapter. Black sand turned to glass beneath the pyre. I kept a handful of those obsidian tears. They sit on my desk even now as I record this testament. A reminder of what we lost. And what we must preserve. News of Constantine's death was suppressed, of course. The Administratum has entire divisions dedicated to controlling such information. But secrets have a way of spreading, especially those heavy with portent. Rumors began almost immediately. The death of the last Space Marine, the extinction of the Adeptus Astartes, at first it was whispers in the officer corps. Worried glances exchanged during strategy meetings. Then it spread to the common soldiers. Prayers offered in secret. Talismans fashioned from anything that might have been touched by a space marine, a bolt shell casing, a fragment of ceramite, a page from a tactical manual bearing an Astartes seal. I ordered increased security around our astropathic choir. Too late. The message had already gone out, rippling across the Imperium through the warp. The angels are gone. The emperor's sons are no more. We stand alone against the darkness. Panic is a curious thing in the Imperium. It moves slowly at first, constrained by distance and the fragmented nature of human communication across the stars. But it builds momentum. It gathers strength from fear and uncertainty. By the time it reaches its peak, it has become something else entirely. something with purpose and direction, something like faith but inverted, a negative belief that corrodes everything it touches. The first riots began on shrine worlds. Pilgrims who had traveled for years to pray at monuments dedicated to space marine victories suddenly found themselves questioning everything. If the angels could die out, what did that mean for the Emperor himself? The ecclesiarchy responded with typical brutality. Arbites firing into crowds, public executions of ringleaders, cathedral squares flowing with blood. It did nothing to stem the tide of doubt. I received reports from across my jurisdiction, governors requesting additional troops to maintain order, cardinal worlds declaring states of emergency as religious sects turned against one another. Mechanicus enclaves sealing their borders, refusing all communication. The Imperium was fracturing along fault lines that had always existed but had been held together by the myth of the Space Marines. the living embodiment of the Emperor's will, and I stood at the center of the storm, the man who had witnessed the death of the last angel, who had heard his final command, endure. But how? That was the question that consumed me as I gathered my staff for an emergency council. How does mankind endure without its protectors? Without the living symbols of the Emperor's power, the command center on my flagship the righteous dominion hummed with nervous energy. Officers from every branch of the Imperial military stood around the strategic hololith, their faces ghoulish in its blue glow. Naval captains with their high collars and gold braid. Guard colonels with their campaign medals and regimental insignia. Stormtrooper commanders in their carapace armor, faces hidden behind reflective visors. No space marines. That absence felt like a physical wound in the room. I called the meeting to order. No preamble, no ceremony. We were beyond such things. Lieutenant Mara Ven, my chief intelligence officer, spoke first. Her voice was steady, but I could see the strain around her eyes. Sleepless nights spend collating reports from across the Crusade zone. The situation is deteriorating rapidly, sir. We have confirmed uprisings on 37 worlds. Unconfirmed reports suggest the number may be closer to 100. The pattern is consistent. Religious discord followed by civil unrest, followed by complete collapse of imperial authority. She manipulated the hololith, zooming in on specific planets, each one a red wound in the blue fabric of imperial space. Gareloch. Pilgrims stormed the Basilica of the Emperor Ascendant. Cardinal Morn executed by his own honor guard. Estimated casualties in the tens of thousands. Voralis Prime. Manufacturing output down. 80%. Worker riots in all major hive cities. The planetary governor has requested exterminatus, rather than risk the forge worlds falling into enemy hands. New Kadia. The entire Astra Militarum Garrison has mutinied. They are demanding confirmation that the Emperor still lives. They claim the extinction of the Space Marines proves he is dead. I raised a hand to stop her. The list would go on. Each world a new variation on the same theme, humanity tearing itself apart in the absence of its guardians. What about the other imperial authorities? I asked." The Inquisition? The Ecclesiarchy? The Mechanicus? Ven hesitated. Her gaze flickered to Admiral Cauch, the senior naval officer present. He nodded slightly, giving permission for something. We have intercepted communications, she said. Unauthorized astropathic transmissions from several sources. The Inquisition has declared a conclave extremis. All Ordos are recalling their agents to fortress worlds. The Ecclesiarchy is split. Conservative factions are declaring all knowledge of the Space Marines heretical. Revisionist factions are claiming the extinction of the Astartes was always part of the Emperor's plan. A test of faith. And the Mechanicus? I pressed. She looked down at her data slate. The Fabricator General has ordered all forge worlds to seal their borders. All Mechanicus vessels are to return to Mars, or their home forges immediately. All research data regarding the Astartes is to be surrendered to a special conclave of genitors. For what purpose? I asked. Venn swallowed hard. According to our sources, they intend to attempt the creation of new space marines, or possibly even new Primarchs. The room erupted in shocked murmurs. I slammed my fist on the hololith controls, sending a burst of static through the projection. The noise died instantly. That is tech heresy of the highest order, I said. The Emperor alone created the Primarchs. The Mechanicus cannot possibly hope to replicate his work. Admiral Kosh cleared his throat. With respect, Lord Militant, he said, desperation breeds innovation and heresy. The Mechanicus knows that without the Space Marines, the Imperium cannot survive. They will try anything, everything. Let them try," interjected Colonel Drace of the Mordian Iron Guard. His face was a mask of stern disapproval, his uniform immaculate despite the crisis. The Mordians always maintained appearances, especially in disaster. Let them commit tech heresy, he continued. It changes nothing. Our duty remains. We fight. We die. We serve the Emperor, with or without his angels. A murmur of agreement ran through the guard officers. The Navy men looked less convinced. They had seen the outer reaches of the Imperium. They knew what lurked in the void between stars, what had been held at bay only through the terror inspired by the Space Marines. Admiral Korsh voiced their concerns. The problem is not just military, he said. The Space Marines were symbols. living proof that the emperor still guided humanity. Without them, the question becomes unavoidable. If the emperor truly ruled, why would he allow his greatest creation to fade away? Careful, Admiral, warned Colonel Drace. Such questions border on heresy, Korsh laughed bitterly. Heresy? Look around you, Colonel. The Imperium is drowning in heresy. Every cult leader and would-be Messiah is proclaiming the death of the Space Marines as vindication, as proof that the Emperor is dead or has abandoned mankind. We cannot execute every citizen who asks uncomfortable questions. There are not enough bolt shells in the segmentum. He was right. I knew it. Everyone in that room knew it. The Imperium was built on faith as much as force. The Space Marines had been the physical embodiment of that faith. The living link to the Emperor and the Great Crusade. Without them, the foundation of Imperial authority was crumbling. I made my decision. Admiral Korsh, I said, prepare the fleet for immediate departure. We are, leaving Antilok Prime. Colonel Drace, I want all guard regiments combat ready within 12 hours. Lieutenant Venn, transmit to all worlds in our jurisdiction. The Seventh Imperial Crusade is mobilizing. Any world that maintains its loyalty will receive our protection. Any that falters will face our judgment. Sir, Venn said hesitantly, we cannot possibly respond to every uprising. We do not have the numbers. Even if we deployed a single company to each troubled world, we would be spread too thin. I know, I replied. But we must be seen to act. Faith in the Emperor comes from works as much as prayer. We will show the Imperium that even without the Space Marines, his will endures. We will be the new angels if we must. Lie to them, said a quiet voice from the edge of the room. All heads turned. Commissar Thorn stood in the shadows, her black uniform making her nearly invisible against the bulkhead. Her pale face floated like a vengeful ghost in the darkness. I had almost forgotten she was there, the political officer assigned to my command by the commissariat, the woman whose job was to maintain morale and loyalty, no matter the cost. Lie to them, she repeated, stepping forward. Tell them the space marines still exist, that they have been called away on a great crusade by the emperor himself." that they fight in distant regions of space against threats too terrible to name. That is a direct falsehood, objected Colonel Drace. We cannot base imperial policy on such a fundamental deception. Commissar Thorne smiled thinly. The Imperium is built on necessary falsehoods, Colonel, the greatest being that the Emperor communicates his will at all. We all know the truth. He sits silent on the golden throne, the Astronomican burns, the black ships gather the Scyca tithe, The machinery of empire grinds on. But direct guidance? There is none. There has never been any. I should have executed her on the spot for such words. That was imperial law. Instead, I found myself considering her proposal, the desperate pragmatism of it, the ruthless logic. They will discover the truth eventually, I said. Lies have limited range. By then it will not matter, she replied. The immediate crisis will have passed. The Imperium will have adapted to a new reality. Faith will find new symbols, new expressions. But right now, we need the lie to prevent total collapse. I looked around the room. At the faces of my officers, I saw doubt, fear, but also determination. they were soldiers of the imperium they would follow orders even orders to perpetuate a fiction that might save countless lives but i could not do it not completely we will not lie i said finally but neither will we broadcast the full truth Official communications will state that the Space Marine chapters have been reorganized, consolidated into new formations by order of the High Lords. Deployed to critical fronts beyond regular imperial jurisdiction, it was a half-truth. The Space Marines were indeed gone, but not deployed, extinct. Yet the fiction would give us time, breathing room to establish a new order. Commissar Thorne nodded, satisfied. The others looked relieved to have a course of action, however morally ambiguous. I dismissed them to their duties, all except Lieutenant Venn. When we were alone, I asked the question that had been burning in my mind since Constantine's death. The gene seed, I said. All of it is truly gone. There are no reserves. No hidden vaults where viable samples might be stored. Venn looked uncomfortable. According to our intelligence, the deterioration was universal, a flaw in the original templates created by the Emperor, perhaps deliberately included as a failsafe, perhaps a result of warp exposure over millennia, Regardless, the corruption spread through all gene lines, even those stored in stasis. The blood angels were the first to go, then the imperial fists. The ultramarines lasted the longest, but even their gene seed eventually failed. And the traitor legions? I asked. The Chaos Space Marines? Venn's eyes widened at the implication of my question. We have reports, she said carefully, that they suffer the same degradation. Their masters in the warp can temporarily stabilize the corruption, but not permanently reverse it. They too are dying out. More slowly, perhaps, but just as inevitably." I nodded, strangely comforted by this knowledge. At least our enemies would not outlive us. The galaxy would be free of the Emperor's creations, both loyal and traitor. You have your orders, Lieutenant, I said. Prepare the astropathic choir for mass transmission. Our message goes to every world in the Crusade Zone. The Emperor protects. She saluted and left me alone with the hololith and its constellation of dying worlds. The emperor protects, I repeated to the empty room. But who protects us now? The righteous dominion broke orbit six hours later, leading a flotilla of warships toward the nearest troubled world. Kuranis IV, an agri-planet, whose vast grain fields fed a dozen neighboring systems. Reports indicated widespread unrest in the main population centers, Arbite's outposts overrun, the planetary governor besieged in his palace, Wheatfields burning. From orbit, those fires were visible as a lacework of orange against the planet's dark side. Admiral Korsh stood beside me on the observation deck, hands clasped behind his back. Food riots are just the beginning, he said quietly. If Kuranis falls, the entire subsector will face starvation within months. That will trigger more unrest. More planets will fall. The cascade effect will be impossible to contain. I know the strategic implications, Admiral," I replied. That is why we are here. To prevent the collapse before it gains momentum, he nodded, unconvinced. The plan was simple in concept, difficult in execution. We would deploy the 112th Mordian Regiment to secure the capital city and relieve the governor. The 89th Cadian mechanized would establish control over the main agricultural processing centers. The 54th Elysian Drop Regiment would hunt down and eliminate the ringleaders of the rebellion. Standard Imperial Pacification Doctrine, applied with overwhelming force and sufficient brutality to make an example of Koranis IV, What made this operation different was the messaging. For the first time in imperial history, we would go to war without invoking the space marines, without promising that the Emperor's angels would descend from the heavens if the situation grew dire. The soldiers knew it, the officers knew it. I saw it in their faces as they boarded the landing craft, the knowledge that they fought alone, that there would be no Ceremit giants coming to turn the tide if they faltered." i addressed the troops before they deployed stood before them in the main landing bay my voice amplified by vox casters thousands of men and women in the uniforms of a dozen different regiments each one a tiny fragment of humanity's will to survive soldiers of the emperor i said You go to battle today not just against rebels and traitors, but against doubt itself. The enemies of mankind believe we are weakened. That without the Adeptus Astartes, the Imperium will crumble. They are wrong. The Emperor's will is carried not just by his angels, but by each of you, by your faith, by your sacrifice. By your unyielding devotion to humanity, I paused, looking out at the sea of faces. Young faces, most of them, men and women who had never seen a space marine in the flesh, who knew them only from statues and stained glass windows and propaganda posters. The Space Marine chapters have been called to a higher purpose, I continued, embracing Commissar Thorn's necessary falsehood. They fight on distant fronts, against enemies you cannot imagine. But we remain, the Imperial Guard, the common soldiers of mankind, and today we will prove that we are enough. that humanity stands or falls by its own strength, by its own courage. A cheer went up from the assembled troops. Not the full-throated roar I had heard in better days, but sincere nonetheless. They wanted to believe, needed to believe. That was the nature of the Imperium. Faith-sustaining reason, myth-enabling action. I raised my hand for silence. When you set foot on Koranis IV, you will face humans who have lost their way, who have surrendered to fear and doubt. Show them no mercy, but offer them this truth. The Emperor protects those who protect themselves. Now go, bring his light to the darkness. Another cheer, stronger this time, The troops filed into their transports, Mordians in their perfect formations, Cadians with their practical efficiency, Elysians checking grav shoots and weapons with methodical precision, the machine of war functioning as it always had, but something was missing. The spiritual center. The knowledge that demigods fought alongside mortal men, I felt its absence like physical pain as I watched the landing craft depart. Commissar Thorne appeared at my shoulder, her face impassive as always. They believe you, she said. For now, faith is a moment-by-moment choice, Commissar, I replied. All we can do is give them reasons to keep choosing it. She nodded, then handed me a data slate. A transmission from terror, she said. Eyes only. I took it and moved to a private alcove off the main bay, The message was brief. Encoded with inquisitorial ciphers, it had come through a secure astropathic relay bypassing the normal chain of command. The sender was identified only as Inquisitor Volk, Ordo Hereticus. The message read, Lord Militant Kest. Your presence is required on terror. The matter concerns the future of the Adeptus Astartes. You will tell no one of this summons. You will come alone. Transport has been arranged. The bearer of this message will provide details. The Emperor protects. I looked up at Thorn, suddenly seeing her in a new light. not just a commissar, but an inquisitorial agent. The political officers had always maintained connections to the Ordo Hereticus. It made perfect sense that she would serve two masters. When? I asked simply. Now, she replied. A ship waits at the edge of the system. Fast courier class. Warp engines specially modified for speed. You will reach terror within the month. I gestured to the viewports where Karanis IV filled the sky. I have a campaign to run, I said. A crusade to salvage. I cannot simply disappear in the middle of an operation. Thorne's expression did not change. You have competent officers, she said. Admiral Korsh can oversee the Koranis pacification. The rest of your strategic initiatives can proceed without your direct supervision. This is not a request, Lord Militant. It is an order from the highest authority. I knew better than to ask which authority. The Inquisition answered only to itself. Not even the High Lords could countermand an inquisitorial summons. Very well, I said. Make the arrangements. Quietly, I will not have the troops thinking I am, abandoning them at the first sign of trouble. Thorne nodded and left without another word. I stood for a long time watching the landing craft descend toward Koranus IV, bright sparks against the darkening atmosphere. Imperial ships carrying imperial soldiers to suppress an imperial rebellion, humanity fighting itself while enemies gathered at the borders of our domain. Was this what the emperor intended? Was this the Imperium he sacrificed himself to create, or had we failed him so completely that even his greatest creations had been allowed to wither and die? I had no answers, only duty, and a summons to the heart of the Empire I had served all my life. I left the righteous dominion twelve hours later, a small shuttle, ostensibly carrying routine dispatches to a naval way station. In reality, it took me to the edge of the Antiloch system, where a sleek vessel waited in the shadow of a dead moon. No markings, no identification transponder. Its hull was a non-reflective black that seemed to drink in light. The ship was called the Unwritten, an inquisitorial fast courier with a crew of servitors and a single human captain who never spoke. My quarters were Spartan but comfortable, a bed, a desk, a small library of physical books, ancient texts bound in materials I chose not to identify, histories of the Imperium, biographies of Primarchs, technical manuals concerning gene seed cultivation. I spent the journey reading, learning things that would have been considered heretical in any other context, the true nature of the Emperor's bargain with the powers on Mars. The lost technologies used to create the Primarchs, the carefully edited history of the Horus heresy. We made the journey to Terra in 22 days. A near miraculous feat of navigation. When we translated back into real space, the cradle of humanity filled the viewports. Terra. Holy Terra. The heart of the Imperium and home of the God Emperor himself. From orbit, it looked like any hive world. The entire planet covered in layer upon layer of urban development, mountains turned to fortresses, oceans drained and paved over. The atmosphere, a toxic miasma held at bay by void shields and atmospheric processes. Only the Imperial Palace stood out, a vast complex covering much of what had once been called the Northern Hemisphere. Even from space, its golden towers caught the light of soul and threw it back defiantly. The unwritten docked at an unmarked bay high in the upper atmosphere, a private facility used only by the Inquisition and certain members of the High Lords. I was transferred to a small atmospheric craft that descended through layers of security, each more stringent than the last. Void shields, weapons, platforms, Formations of gunships that appeared out of cloud banks, scanned our vessel, then vanished back into the perpetual haze. We landed not at the palace itself, but at a facility some distance away. a nondescript building lost among the gothic spires and monumental cathedrals of the imperial district. Inside, Inquisitor Volk was waiting. He was a small man, unimpressive at first glance. Balding, pale-skinned from a lifetime spent indoors. He wore simple robes of dark gray, unadorned except for a small inquisitorial rosette on the collar. no weapons that i could see though i had no doubt he was capable of killing me in a dozen different ways lord militant kest he said his voice surprisingly deep for such a slight frame thank you for coming so promptly i apologize for the secrecy but what i am about to show you must remain hidden from all but a select few He led me through featureless corridors to a lift platform that descended for what felt like ours, down into the bedrock of Terra itself, into chambers that predated the Imperium, perhaps even predated human civilization. We emerged into a vast circular room. The walls were lined with stasis chambers, hundreds of them, each containing a single specimen floating in amber fluid, human in, basic form, but altered. enhanced, each one unique in its modifications. The Primark Project, Volk said simply. Not the original, of course. That was lost millennia ago. This is our attempt to recreate the Emperor's work, to birth new gene lines that might replace those that have failed. I stared at the specimens in horror and fascination. Some were clearly failures, Grotesque parodies of human form, twisted by genetic manipulation gone wrong. Others looked almost perfect. Giant transhuman bodies with proportions that echoed the statues of Primarchs I had seen in Imperial cathedrals. How long has this been going on? I asked. Volk moved to a control lectern at the center of the room. He manipulated glowing runes that pulsed with gentle light. Since the first signs of gene seed deterioration appeared three centuries ago, he said, the High Lords authorized the project in secret. Only a handful of people know of its existence. The fabricator general, the master of the administratum, certain members of the Inquisition. And now you, why me? I asked. I am a soldier, not a genitor or a scholar, Volk smiled thinly. Because you witnessed the death of the last space marine, he said, you heard his final words. And because you command the only significant military force that might maintain order when the truth can no longer be hidden, he gestured to the specimens. We have made progress, he continued. significant progress. The latest iterations are stable, viable. They lack the Emperor's direct genetic imprint, of course, but they contain elements of the original Primark DNA recovered from various sources. Relics. Blood samples preserved by the chapters, even material extracted from traitor Primarks. That is tech heresy, I said automatically. The creation of artificial life is forbidden by the Mechanicus Creed. Volk laughed. The Space Marines were the original tech heresy, Lord Militant. The Emperor himself violated the precepts of Mars to create them. We merely follow, in his footsteps, out of necessity, out of desperation. He turned to face me directly. The question is not whether we should do this work, it is already done. The question is what happens next. Do we reveal these new primarks to the Imperium? Do we begin the process of creating new space marine chapters? Or do we find another path forward? I looked at the specimens floating in their amniotic chambers. Not men, not gods. Something in between. Weapons created by science to serve a failing empire. How many of the High Lords support this project? I asked. Volk hesitated, then answered with clear reluctance. The council is divided. Some believe we must proceed at any cost. Others fear the consequences of creating new transhuman warriors without the Emperor's direct blessing. The Ecclesiarchy is particularly opposed. They claim only the Emperor has the divine right to create such beings. That for mere men to attempt it is the highest blasphemy. and what do you believe inquisitor i asked volk moved to one of the stasis chambers inside floated a perfect specimen a giant with noble features reminiscent of the statues of robut gilemon he placed his hand against the glass a gesture that mirrored my own farewell to constantine I believe the Imperium cannot survive as it was built," he said quietly. The Emperor created the Space Marines for a specific purpose, to reunite humanity, to conquer the galaxy. That purpose has been fulfilled, after a fashion. Perhaps their time has truly passed. Perhaps humanity must stand on its own now. He turned back to me. But I also believe that symbols have power. Faith requires objects of devotion, The Imperium needs its angels, whether they are the Emperor's direct creation or a pale imitation created by desperate men. He was asking me to choose, to cast my lot with one faction or another in this hidden struggle for the future of mankind. I, who had witnessed the death of the last true space marine, I, who had heard his final command, endure, not recreate, not replace, endure. I made my decision. Destroy them, I said. All of them. This facility. These specimens. The research. Burn it to ash and scatter it to the void. Then tell the High Lords the truth. The Space Marines are gone. And they are not coming back. Whatever response he had expected, it was not this. That would doom the Imperium, he protested. Without the Space Marines, we cannot hold back the enemies that gather at our borders. The Tyrannids, the Necrons, the forces of chaos. They will overwhelm us within centuries. Perhaps sooner. The Space Marines were never our salvation, I replied. They were a tool, one of many the Emperor created. Humanity survived for millennia before they existed. It will survive after they are gone, but not by clinging to the past, not by creating flawed copies of what we have lost. I gestured to the specimens. These are not Primarchs, I said. They are abominations, twisted reflections of the Emperor's work. If you unleash them on the galaxy, you will not save the Imperium. You will destroy it from within. Volk studied me for a long moment. I could not read the expression on his face. Anger, disappointment, or perhaps unexpected respect. You may be right, Lord Militant, he said finally. But the decision is not yours to make, nor mine. We are servants of the Imperium. We obey the will of the High Lords. Then bring me to them, I demanded. Let me speak to them directly. Let me tell them what I saw on Antelok Prime. What the last Space Marine said with his dying breath. Volk nodded slowly. Very well, he said. It will take time to arrange. The High Lords do not grant audiences easily, even to a Lord militant, but I will make it happen. In the meantime, you will be my guest here on Terra. You will speak of this to no one. Is that understood? No. I agreed, having little choice. Inquisitors were not known for their willingness to take no for an answer. Volk escorted me back to the present, or surface, to quarters prepared in one of the many administrative blocks surrounding the Imperial Palace. A comfortable prison where I would wait for my audience with the rulers of mankind. Days passed, then weeks. I was given limited access to information about the ongoing crisis in the Imperium. Reports filtered through inquisitorial channels, carefully selected and curated, but enough to see that the situation was deteriorating exactly as I had feared. Forty-two worlds in open rebellion, seventeen more teetering on the brink. The Seventh Crusade, now under Admiral Korsha's command, fighting desperate holding actions on a dozen fronts. the ecclesiarchy fragmenting into competing sects, each with its own interpretation of what the extinction of the space marines meant for imperial doctrine, and whispers, always whispers, of Xenos encroachments along the eastern fringe, of Chaos warbands growing bolder in their raids, of Necron tomb worlds awakening in unprecedented numbers, as if sensing the Imperium's moment of weakness. The enemies of mankind could smell blood in the water. They knew. Somehow they knew that humanity's greatest defenders were gone, that the angels who had held them at bay for 10,000 years were no more. On the thirtieth day of my confinement, Volk returned. He looked haggard, exhausted. The strain of the crisis evident in the deep lines around his eyes. The High Lords will see you, he said without preamble. Tomorrow you will be given one hour to present your case. No more. Make it count, Lord Militant. The fate of the Imperium may depend on your words. I spent the night preparing my arguments, not with data slates or strategic assessments. Those would be meaningless to the High Lords, who had access to far more information than I could ever possess. No, I prepared my heart, my conviction, my belief in what the last Space Marine had meant when he commanded me to endure. The Chamber of the High Lords was not what I expected. I had imagined a grand cathedral space, golden thrones, Baroque decorations befitting the rulers of a million worlds. Instead, I found myself in a relatively austere room deep within the Imperial Palace. The walls were bare rock-crete, the lighting harsh and functional. The only concession to status was a semicircular table of polished black stone, where the twelve highest officials in the Imperium sat in simple chairs. They did not all attend in person. Some were present only as hololith projections. Others sent representatives. But the power in that room was palpable. The living embodiments of the emperor's government, each one controlling an aspect of the vast machine that was the imperium of man. The master of the administratum, a withered ancient whose age was impossible to determine. the fabricator general of mars more machine than human mechadendrites writhing around his augmented body like metallic serpents the grand provost marshal of the adeptus arbitase a granite-faced woman whose blind cybernetic eyes seemed to see through flesh to the soul beneath the Chancellor of the Estate Imperium, hidden behind a featureless golden mask, the Speaker for the Chartist Captains, his skin the pale blue of someone who had spent a lifetime in the void. The Lord Commander Militant of the Imperial Guard, My Ultimate Superior, a stern-faced veteran whose chest was a constellation of campaign medals, and others. The Paternoval Envoy of the Navis Nobilite, the Master of the Astronomican, the Abyss of the Adeptus Astratelepathica, the Grand Master of Assassins, present only as a shadowed silhouette, the Cardinal of the Holy Synod of Terror, representing the ecclesiarchy. And finally, the inquisitorial representative, not Volk but a woman whose face was half hidden behind a hood of deep crimson, they watched in silence as I was led to the center of the chamber. No chair was provided. I would stand before their judgment, as was fitting for a servant in the presence of masters. Lord Militant Varro Kest intoned the master of the administratum, his voice surprisingly strong given his decrepit appearance. You have requested this audience to discuss the extinction of the Adeptus Astartes. Proceed. Your time is limited. I took a deep breath, straightened my uniform, met each of their gazes in turn. These were the rulers of mankind, the stewards of the Emperor's realm. They deserved my respect, but not my fear. My lords, I began. Thirty-two days ago, I witnessed the death of Chapter Master Constantine of the Iron Sentinels. the last space marine in the Imperium of Man. I watched as his gene seed, the final viable sample in existence, degraded beyond recovery. I heard his last word, endure. I paused, letting the weight of that moment sink in. Since then, I have seen the consequences of this loss ripple across the Imperium. Worlds in rebellion, faith in crisis, our enemies growing bolder by the day. I have also seen our response. the desperate attempt to recreate what we have lost. The Primark Project The fabricator general's mechadendrites writhed in agitation. The inquisitorial representative leaned forward slightly, I had their attention now. I am here to tell you that this approach is wrong, I continued. The Space Marines are gone. That is a reality we must accept. But it is not the catastrophe we fear. It is an opportunity. A chance to reshape the Imperium into something that can survive without its angels. The Cardinal of the Holy Synod slammed his palm against the black stone table. Blasphemy, he hissed. The Space Marines are the Emperor's divine creation. His gift to humanity, to suggest we are better without them, is heresy of the highest order. I held my ground. I do not suggest we are better without them, your eminence. I acknowledge that we are without them and must find a way forward. The Emperor created the Space Marines for a purpose. That purpose has been fulfilled. Perhaps their extinction is not a failure, but part of the... Emperor's plan. The next step in mankind's evolution. The Cardinal subsided, though his face remained a mask of disapproval. The Lord Commander Militant spoke next, his voice the practiced growl of a career officer. Pretty words, Kest. But strategic realities remain. The Space Marines held our borders against threats that ordinary Imperial forces cannot hope to contain. Without them, we face military collapse within decades. I nodded, acknowledging the point. That is true, Lord Commander, if we continue to fight as we always have, but necessity breeds adaptation. The Astra Militarum can evolve. New tactics. New technologies. The resources that once supported the space marine chapters can be redirected to create elite human units. Not as powerful individually, but more numerous, more sustainable. The fabricator general's voice emerged from a Vox grill set in his chest, a metallic rasp that barely sounded human. The Primark Project offers a superior solution, he said. We have nearly perfected the gene templates. The new specimens show none of the degradation that affected the original gene seed. They could be superior to the Emperor's own creations. I shook my head. At what cost, Lord Fabricator? The moral cost of playing God? The practical cost of creating new transhuman warriors who may turn against us? as half the Primarchs did during the heresy, and what message would it send to the Imperium? That the High Lords believe they can improve upon the Emperor's work? That faith in his designs is negotiable when convenience demands it. The hooded inquisitorial representative spoke for the first time, her voice soft but carrying easily through the chamber. Lord Militant Kest raises valid concerns, she said. The creation of new primarchs, without the Emperor's direct guidance, would set a dangerous precedent. It would undermine the very foundations of imperial authority. If the High Lords can replace one aspect of the Emperor's work, why not others? Why not all? Where? Does it end? The Master of the Administratum raised a skeletal hand for silence. What exactly are you proposing, Lord Militant? he asked. If not the Primark project, then what? How does the Imperium survive the loss of its greatest defenders? I took a step forward. This was the moment. The heart of my argument. We tell the truth, I said simply. Not all at once. Not without preparation. But gradually, we acknowledge that the Space Marines are gone. We rewrite the Imperial Creed to frame their extinction as the completion of their purpose, not its failure. We create a new mythology, one in which ordinary humans carry the Emperor's light forward. I looked each High Lord in the eye as I continued. Mankind stood alone before the Emperor created the Space Marines, it can stand alone again but only if we believe it can only if that belief becomes the new foundation of the imperium the chamber fell silent the high lords exchanged glances some thoughtful some skeptical some openly hostile the cardinal was the first to break the silence The ecclesiarchy would never support such a radical revision of doctrine, he declared. The divinity of the Space Marines is a cornerstone of imperial faith. to suggest they were temporary, that their purpose has been fulfilled, would shake the belief of trillions. Then shape that belief your eminence, I countered. Is that not the purpose of the ecclesiarchy? To interpret the emperor's will for the masses, tell them that the space marines have ascended, that they have joined the emperor in a higher form of existence, that their work in the material realm is complete, and now mankind must prove itself worthy of their sacrifice." The cardinal frowned, but I could see the idea taking root. The religious mind always found ways to incorporate new realities into existing doctrine. It was the nature of faith to adapt, even as it claimed unchanging truth. The Grand Provost-Marshall spoke next, her blind augmatic eyes fixed on my face, with unnerving precision. The maintenance of order is my concern, she said. Your proposal would trigger unrest on a scale we have never seen. Entire sectors would erupt in rebellion once the truth became known. The Arbites cannot contain such widespread disorder. Better a controlled revelation than an uncontrolled discovery. I replied. The truth is already spreading, despite our efforts to contain it. Each day we maintain the fiction, the eventual reckoning grows more severe, better to manage the process, to prepare the Imperium for the knowledge that is coming, whether we will it or not. The Lord Commander Militant leaned forward, resting his fists on the black stone table. And militarily, he demanded, How do we compensate for the loss of the Adeptus Astartes on the battlefield? Faith and doctrine are all well and good, but they will not stop a tyrannid hive fleet or a black crusade. I met his gaze steadily. As I said, Lord Commander, we adapt, we evolve. The Militarum has always borne, the brunt of the Imperium's wars. The Space Marines were a scalpel, not a hammer. A precision instrument used at critical points. Without them, we developed new strategies, more stormtrooper regiments, better coordination with the Navy, greater reliance on overwhelming firepower rather than surgical strikes. It will not be easy. It will not be without losses. But it can be done. The fabricator general's macaindrites coiled and uncoiled in agitation. What of the Primark project? he asked." The resources already invested, the progress made. Would you have us simply discard decades of research? Destroy specimens that could save the Imperium? I nodded firmly. Yes, Lord Fabricator. Exactly that. The project is an abomination, a tech heresy that betrays everything the Mechanicus claims to stand for, the preservation of knowledge, not its perversion. You cannot replicate the Emperor's work because you do not possess his unique connection to the warp. His singular understanding of genetic manipulation, his divine foresight. Any attempt to create new Primarchs will result in monsters, not saviors. The chamber erupted in argument, high lords speaking over one another. Accusations and counter-arguments flying across the black stone table. I stood silent in the center, watching as the rulers of mankind grappled with the future I had proposed, a future without space marines, without transhuman heroes to stand between humanity and the darkness. Finally, the master of the administratum raised both hands, calling for silence. The chamber gradually quieted, "'Lord Militant Kest has given us much to consider,' he said. "'This is not a decision to be made in haste, nor in the heat of emotion. "'We will deliberate on his proposals and the alternatives before us. "'The future of the Imperium hangs in the balance. "'He looked at me, his ancient eyes unreadable. "'You are dismissed, Lord Militant. "'Return to your assigned quarters. "'We will summon you when a decision has been reached.' I bowed and, withdrew, escorted by the same silent servitors who had brought me to the chamber. Behind me, I could hear the debate resuming. The voices of the High Lords fading as the massive doors swung shut. In my quarters, I waited. Hours passed. Then days. I received no information, no indication of which way the High Lords were leaning. Inquisitor Volk did not return. I was alone with my thoughts, and the growing certainty that I had done what was right, regardless of the consequences. On the seventh day, I was summoned again. not to the chamber of the high lords but to a small antechamber where the inquisitorial representative waited still hooded in crimson the high lords have reached a decision she said without preamble it was not unanimous but it was decisive the primark project will be terminated the specimens destroyed the research sealed in the deepest vaults of terror never to be accessed again i felt a weight lift from my shoulders At least that abomination would not be inflicted on the galaxy. And the truth, I asked, will it be revealed? She nodded slowly. In stages... As you suggested, the Ecclesiarchy will begin to revise the Imperial Creed. Subtle changes at first. New interpretations of old texts. Suggestions that the Space Marines were always meant to be a temporary blessing that their time has passed as the Emperor foresaw. She paused, studying me from beneath her hood. You have set events in motion that cannot be reversed, Lord Militant, she continued. The Imperium that emerges from this crisis will not be the same as the one that entered it. Whether it will be stronger or weaker remains to be seen, but it will endure. As the last Space Marine commanded, I accepted her words with a nod. There was nothing more to say. The path was set. Now we had to walk it, wherever it might lead. She extended a data slate to me. Your new orders, she said. You are to return to the Seventh Crusade immediately. Admiral Korsh has managed admirably in your absence, but your leadership is required for what comes next. The pacification of the rebellious worlds, the reorganization of imperial forces, the beginning of the transition to a post-Astarty's military doctrine. I took the slate, scanning the orders briefly. They were comprehensive, ambitious, a complete restructuring of imperial strategy in my theatre of operations. a template that would eventually be applied throughout the Imperium, if successful. There was one more question I needed to ask. And what of Antiloch Prime, the place where the last Space Marine died? The Inquisitorial representative's voice softened almost imperceptibly. It will become a shrine world, she said, not immediately, but eventually. a place of pilgrimage where the faithful can contemplate the sacrifice of the angels and their ascension to the emperor's side, where they can learn the new truth. That humanity must now stand on its own, as the emperor always intended. I nodded, satisfied. It felt right that Constantine's final resting-place should serve such a purpose, that his death should mark not just an ending, but a beginning. I left terror the next day aboard the same unmarked vessel that had brought me. The journey back to the Seventh Crusade took nearly a month. In that time, I prepared myself for the task ahead. The reshaping of an imperial crusade, the implementation of a new doctrine. The careful revelation of a truth that would shake the foundations of everything my soldiers believed. When the unwritten translated back into real space at the edge of the Quranist system, I was ready. or so I thought. The Vox officer approached me on the bridge, his face pale. My lord, he said, handing me a data slate. Urgent communication from Admiral Korsch. Multiple astropathic confirmations. Priority vermilion. I took the slate, scanning the message quickly. Then again, more slowly, as the implications sank in, Koranis Forf had fallen. Not to rebellion, but to something far worse. A tyrannid, splinter fleet, separated from Hive Fleet Leviathan. It had descended on the Agri world without warning. The Imperial forces, spread thin across multiple fronts, had been overwhelmed. Admiral Cauch had ordered Exterminatus rather than allow the world to be consumed, and its biomass added to the tyrannid host. But that was not the worst of it. The splinter fleet was just the vanguard. Long-range Ogre arrays had detected a much larger force approaching the sector, not just tyrannids. Necron tomb ships had been identified at the outer reaches of three neighboring systems. Chaos warbands were striking with unprecedented coordination along the spinward front. It was as if they knew, as if every enemy of mankind had received the same message at once. The angels are gone. The time to strike is now. The reality I had warned the High Lords about was unfolding faster than any of us had anticipated. The Imperium without its space marines was a beacon of weakness to predators across the galaxy, and they were closing in. I composed my reply to Admiral Korsh. Simple. Direct. In keeping with my new understanding of what the Imperium must become, Hold position. Consolidate forces. Abandon outlying worlds if necessary to create a defensible perimeter. I am inbound. Prepare the fleet for immediate combat operations. The Emperor protects. I added a personal note, just for Korsh. What comes next will test us as we have never been tested. but remember this we are the guardians of mankind now not demigods or angels just men and women standing against the darkness it is enough it must be as the unwritten accelerated toward the waiting battle-fleet i stood at the viewport watching the stars streak past Somewhere out there, the enemies of mankind gathered, hungry, relentless, sensing our moment of weakness. But we would endure, not as we had been, but as something new, an imperium of mankind alone, without angels or demigods to save us. Just billions upon billions of human souls, bound together by faith and determination, and the simple will to survive. Constantine's final command echoed in my mind as I prepared to rejoin my forces, to lead them into a war unlike any the Imperium had faced before. A war for the future of humanity itself. Endure, and we would. Whatever came next, whatever the cost, humanity would endure. The God Emperor had created the Space Marines to unite mankind, to carve out an empire among the stars. They had served that purpose. Now they were gone, and we were left to defend what they had built. With faith, with courage, with the stubborn tenacity that had always been mankind's greatest strength, As I stood on the threshold of this new era, I felt not despair but resolve. The Imperium would survive the extinction of the space marines. It would adapt, evolve, perhaps even grow stronger through the crucible of this crisis. Not because of new primarks or genetic manipulations, but because ordinary humans would rise to fill the void, left by the angels. That was the future I had argued for before the High Lords. the future I would now help create. An imperium of man in truth as well as name, standing alone against the darkness. The stars beyond the viewport seemed colder somehow, more distant, as if the universe itself had grown more hostile now that the Emperor's finest warriors were no more. but we would face it nonetheless. We would fight, we would die if necessary, and in the end we would triumph, because that was what it meant to be human in the grim darkness of the far future, to endure, to persist, to carry the emperor's light forward, step by painful step into the endless night.

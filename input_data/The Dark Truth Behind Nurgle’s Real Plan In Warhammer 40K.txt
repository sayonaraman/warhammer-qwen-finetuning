Every plague has a pattern. I've counted billions of deaths across thousands of worlds, and what I've discovered should be impossible. The god of decay doesn't want chaos at all. He wants something far worse. And now I know why the universe is becoming uniform. I remember the moment when the patterns began to reveal themselves to me. 7 billion 413 million 922,816 souls consumed by the walking postule on Gradial IV, 317 million 612,473 claimed by the red weeping on Cadia before its fall. Numbers upon numbers, deaths upon deaths, all carefully recorded by my quill as I moved through the garden. It was my sacred duty, my burden, my privilege. I am Magister Epidemius, the Tally Keeper, chief plague-bearer of Grandfather Nurgle, and I have counted every death brought about by his loving hand since time immemorial. The garden stretches endlessly in all directions, a riot of diseased life and vibrant decay. Its geography defies mortal cartography, regions shifting and flowing into one another like pus from a lanced boil. What appears distant may suddenly loom immediate, what seems adjacent may require days of travel to reach. Landmarks appear familiar until approached, revealing themselves to be grotesque parodies of their previous incarnation. Pools of bubbling filth nurture blooms of impossible beauty, their petals formed from crystallized agony, stems pulsing with lymphatic fluid stolen from a billion victims. Forests of fungal growths tower overhead, their canopies releasing spores that form shapes in the air, complex mathematical patterns that whisper secrets to those with the wit to comprehend them, Trees heavy with ripened boils, sway in breezes thick with spores, their trunks split to reveal faces frozen in expressions of rapturous agony, their roots drinking deep from the liquefied remains of those who once denied grandfather's gifts. Insects the size of battle tanks burrow through soil composed entirely of desiccated flesh, leaving tunnels that form the arterial networks of the garden itself, carrying nutrients and disease from one region to another. Rivers of bile flow uphill and down simultaneously, their currents home to fish-like entities that were once the proud void ships of imperial fleets, now reduced and transformed but still bearing the faint markings of their former glory. The skies above, if such a direction can truly be said to exist in this realm, shift constantly from vibrant greens to sickly yellows to the bruised purple of infected flesh. Sometimes they weep fluids that sizzle where they land. Other times they remain clear enough to see the other domains of the warp beyond, distant and distorted as if viewed through the cataracts of a diseased eye. This is my home, my paradise, my eternity. I walk its paths dutifully, tallying the great works of my master upon. My scroll of parchment, itself made from the tanned skin of a long-dead planetary governor who denied grandfather entry to his world. How foolish the mortal mind to think one can refuse the embrace that awaits all things. My form is ancient now, bloated with purpose and knowledge. My single eye sees not just the physical world, but the patterns of contagion as they spread across reality. The bell at my side rings with each significant milestone, another world fallen, another species extinct another plague perfected the sound pleases grandfather and what pleases him brings me joy but joy has become distant to me of late for in my counting in my endless tallying of death and rebirth i have noticed something that should not be a pattern where there should be only glorious chaotic proliferation A symmetry in the numbers that defies the very nature of what we represent. It began on the agri-world of Septimus Minoris. A simple rot took hold in the vast fields of golden wheat, nothing spectacular by our standards, merely a testing ground for one of grandfather's minor creations. I recorded the spread as was my duty, 14 days for total infestation, 17 million dead from starvation in the following month. Standard, predictable, satisfying work. But then came the outbreak on Terribus, a hive world sixteen sectors distant, different disease entirely, different population, different planetary conditions. And yet, when I examined my records, the pattern of spread was identical, not similar, identical. down to the individual hour of manifestation across population centers. Coincidence, I told myself. The great garden grows in mysterious ways, and sometimes the same flower blooms twice. But my curiosity was peaked, and once roused, a plague-bearer's curiosity is nearly impossible to satisfy. I consulted my ancient scrolls, the tally sheets from millennia past. Epidemics across time and space, plagues visited upon races long extinct, infections that had claimed civilizations whose names are no longer even whispered in the darkest corners of the galaxy. And there it was, again, and again, and again. the same patterns repeating across the vastness of creation defying all logic all science all sorcery what disturbed me most was not the repetition itself but what it represented for grandfather nurgle is the lord of decay the master of plague and pestilence the god of death and rebirth his domain is one of constant change of endless cycles of infinite variation and yet here was proof of something static something unchanging, something permanent. The implications chilled even my rotting heart. I still remember when I brought my concerns to Kugath Plaguefather, most favored of Nurgle's great unclean ones. We met in the festering swamps at the far edges of the garden, where the borders between realms grow thin, and the whispers of other gods can sometimes be heard on the fetid wind. Kugath was ancient even by the timeless. Standards of the Garden. Once, so the stories go, he had been a tiny nurgling, one of the least of grandfather's children. But he had tumbled into one of the master's cauldrons, consuming a potion intended for the emperor of mankind himself. The brew had transformed him, swelling his form to titanic proportions, imbuing him with intellect and ambition far beyond his humble origins. His failure to fulfill the potion's intended purpose haunted him still. It drove him to perfect his alchemical arts, to create contagions of such sublime potency that grandfather would finally forgive his ancient mistake. I found him hunched over a pool of brackish fluid, his massive form reflected in its still surface. Flies swarmed around him in clouds so thick they formed shifting patterns against the sickly green sky, spelling out mathematical formulas that dissolved before they could be fully comprehended. The noxious brew of his latest experiment bubbled gently, releasing spores that caused the surrounding vegetation to wither and transform, branches becoming tentacles, leaves turning to thin sheets of suppurating skin. You worry too much, little counter. Kugath had laughed when I presented my findings, his massive form quivering with mirth, sending ripples through the filthy waters surrounding us. Numbers are playthings, not truths. The mortal realm dies and is reborn according to grandfather's whim, not by some cold mathematics. But I could see doubt in his many weeping eyes. kugath was a master alchemist and masters of any science recognize patterns when they are revealed he had seen something similar in his own experiments though he dared not speak of it openly the sacred number of seven i pressed showing him my tallies seven phases of infection Seven stages of decay. Seven levels of suffering before death. Seven forms of rebirth from the remains. Always seven. Always the same. Across every plague we have ever created, seven is our number, Kugath. Replied, but his voice had lost its certainty. It has always been thus. No, I insisted. Seven is our number because grandfather made it so. But why? Why constrain the infinite possibilities of plague to these rigid structures? Why impose order on what should be glorious entropy? Kugarth had no answer for me then. He simply turned away, lumbering back toward the heart of the garden, his usual jovial demeanor subdued. I knew I had planted a seed of doubt in his mind. But seeds in the garden grow into terrible things indeed. In the days that followed, I became obsessed. I reviewed every tally, every record, every count I had ever made. The evidence was irrefutable. Every plague, every epidemic, every isolated outbreak followed the same fundamental patterns. There were variations, of course, superficial differences that gave the appearance of novelty. But beneath the surface, the skeleton of infection was identical across all of creation. What did this mean? What was Grandfather purpose in this strange uniformity? I had to know. And there was only one way to find the truth. I would have to ask Grandfather himself. None approach the plague god directly without invitation. Even his most favored servants know better than to disturb his endless experimentations within the rotting mansion at the garden center. But I was desperate for answers. My entire existence was built around understanding the patterns of Nurgle's work. If those patterns were deliberate constraints rather than natural evolution, then what was my purpose? What was any of our purposes? I made my way through the garden, past bubbling cauldrons the size of small moons, past the playgrounds where nurglings tormented the souls of those who had denied grandfather's gifts in life, past the breeding pens where new diseases were tested on captive daemons and mortals alike. The deeper I traveled into the garden, the more I noticed the symmetry in all things, the careful balance of suffering and release, the precise timing of decay and renewal. How had I never seen it before? It was as if a veil had been lifted from my single eye, and suddenly the truth of the garden was laid bare before me. Grandfather's realm was not the chaotic playground of entropy I had always believed it to be, It was a carefully managed ecosystem, with every element serving a precise function. The mansion loomed before me, a colossal structure of rotting wood and oxidized metal, perpetually dissolving and reforming in a cycle that had continued since the birth of the universe. From within, I could hear grandfather's laughter, a sound both terrifying and comforting, the laugh of a being who sees the joke at the center of all existence. I hesitated at the threshold. No one entered uninvited, no one questioned the grandfather's methods. To do either was to risk annihilation, or worse, disappointment. But the need to know burned within me like the most virulent of fevers. I entered. The interior of the mansion, defied mortal comprehension. Spaces expanded and contracted without reason. Corridors led to rooms that could not possibly exist within the physical constraints of the structure. Staircases spiraled upward and downward simultaneously. Gravity shifted with each doorway crossed. In one chamber, I found myself walking on the ceiling, looking down at furniture that hung impossibly from what should have been the floor. In another, liquids flowed upward, forming pools that clung to the underside of stone archways like mercury. The air itself was alive with contagion, each breath bringing new sensations. One moment, the sweet copper tang of fresh blood filled my lungs. The next, the acrid bite of industrial chemicals. Then the earthy richness of fresh loam teeming with worms and larvae. My single eye watered constantly, not from irritation but from the overwhelming assault of stimulus, the sheer impossible depth of perception required to process what lay before me, And everywhere, evidence of grandfather's work. Bubbling flasks of contagion-lined walls that breathed and pulsed with a rhythm matching my own heartbeat. Rithing specimens suspended in luminous fluids reached toward me as I passed, their transformed anatomies defying classification. Were they once human? Eldar? Orc? It was impossible to tell, their bodies having transcended the narrow categories of species, becoming something more universal, more pure in their corruption. Libraries filled with mouldering tomes stretched into infinity, each book containing the complete medical history of a world now lost to time. I recognize some of the names embossed on their spines, Worlds I had personally watched fall to Grandfather's embrace. Others were completely unknown to me, perhaps from distant galaxies or realities parallel to our own. Perhaps even worlds yet to be infected, their histories recorded before they had even occurred. Time means little in the warp and less still in Grandfather's domain. And, at the center of it all, Grandfather himself. Massive beyond reckoning, a mountain of rotting flesh and vibrant disease surrounded by his beloved nurglings who gambled about his feet like favored pets. His form was a testament to the beauty of decay, each fold of his bloated flesh, an ecosystem unto itself, home to countless species of parasite and infection. Some were visible to the naked eye, squirming maggots the size of my arm, centipedes whose segments housed different stages of the same disease, butterflies whose wings shed spores with each lazy flap. Others existed on a microscopic level, entire civilizations of bacteria waging wars across the landscape of his enormous body, rising and falling in the span of seconds. His face, what could be seen of it beneath the writhing mass of maggots and the drooping folds of necrotic skin, was locked in an expression of jovial concentration as he stirred a cauldron large enough to hold a battleship. One eye was a postulant yellow, leaking, a thick fluid that sizzled as it dripped into the cauldron, catalyzing reactions within. The other was a constellation of smaller eyes, hundreds of them, each a different color, each focused on a different part of his work. Some looked at me as I approached, blinking in sequence to form patterns that my mind translated instinctively into feelings of welcome and amusement. His arms, too numerous to count, moved independently of one another, each performing a different task in his grand experiment. Some stirred various concoctions. Others dissected specimens with delicate precision despite their enormous size. Still others wrote in massive tomes, recording results, or perhaps composing new recipes for future plagues. One seemed to be idly playing a game with a group of nurglings, flicking them into the air and catching them, the daemons squealing with delight at each toss. and most disturbing of all, his mouth, a cavern large enough to swallow a titan, split his face in a perpetual smile, of genuine joy and affection. For that is grandfather's true nature, not malice or cruelty, but love. A love so profound, so all-consuming that it cannot help but destroy what it touches, transforming it into something new, something that can withstand the burden of being so deeply cherished. I approached slowly, reverently, my bell silent out of respect, but grandfather did not need to hear my bell to know of my presence. He knows every microbe in his realm, every spore, every bacterium. I am but a larger collection of the same. Ah, my faithful epidemius, he said without turning, his voice like the sound of meat rotting, somehow both repulsive and deeply soothing." My counter of plagues, my keeper of tallies, what brings you to my laboratory unbidden? Have you finally completed the count of the Drolaxian flu? 7 trillion, 942 billion, 618 million, 312,944, was it not? Precision of his knowledge did not surprise me. Grandfather knows all that occurs within his domain, but it confirmed what I had begun to suspect. the numbers were not merely records they were blueprints specifications formulas great-grandfather i said prostrating myself before him my bloated form pressing against the squirming carpet of the mansion floor I come seeking understanding. I have noticed patterns in the tallies, symmetries that repeat across all your great works. I fear I have failed in my duty, that I have missed some crucial aspect of your divine plan. Grandfather's laughter shook the mansion, causing droplets of various fluids to rain down from the ceiling. Some sizzled where they landed. Others spawned tiny, short-lived organisms that crawled briefly before expiring. Failed? Failed? O my faithful Epidemias, you have not failed. You have succeeded beyond my expectations. Few of my children ever see the patterns. Fewer still dare to question them. You have done both. You have earned the right to know." Grandfather turned then, fixing me with eyes that contained universes of suffering and release. His smile, stretched across a face wider than a battle tank, was genuine in its affection. "'Come,' he said, gesturing to the cauldron. "'Look upon my greatest work, the culmination of all my efforts "'since the birth of consciousness in this cold universe. "'I approached the cauldron cautiously. "'Within its depth swirled a concoction unlike any I had seen before.' It was not a single disease, but rather seemed to contain elements of every plague ever conceived, all suspended in perfect harmony, neither destroying nor dominating one another. What do you see, my counter of sorrows? Grandfather asked. I stared into the swirling mass, my enhanced vision allowing me to perceive the interactions of the countless pathogens within, and then, suddenly, I understood. Stability, I whispered, the word feeling blasphemous on my tongue. I see perfect stability. Grandfather's hand, the size of a titan, came to rest gently upon my shoulder, a gesture of approval, of pride. Yes, he said simply. Stability. The one thing this universe lacks, the one thing it has always lacked. But grandfather, I dared to ask, are you not the Lord of Decay? Is your domain not change itself, the eternal cycle of death and rebirth? That is what they believe, grandfather said, his voice suddenly serious, the joviality momentarily set aside. That is what even most of my children believe, that I seek only to spread suffering and disease for their own sake, that I revel in the constant churn of life into death, into life again. A simplistic understanding born of simplistic minds. He gestured broadly, encompassing not just the mansion or the garden, but all of creation beyond. Look at this universe, my faithful counter. What do you see? Entropy, dissolution, the slow, inevitable descent into chaos and nothingness. The mortal races call me a god of chaos, but they understand neither chaos nor godhood. I am order masquerading as disorder. I am preservation disguised as decay. I struggled to comprehend. You seek to preserve the universe? Through disease? Through transformation, grandfather corrected. The universe is dying, Epidemious. It has been dying since the moment it was born. The energies of the warp tear at it. The appetites of my brother gods consume it. The folly of mortals wounds it. Left unchecked, eventually nothing would remain but void. He reached into the cauldron, his massive hand unaffected by the lethal brew within, and lifted out a droplet on one finger. The droplet contained entire ecosystems of bacteria and viruses, each existing in perfect equilibrium with the others. But I have found the solution," he continued. If all living things were to become one thing, one perfect organism, infinitely adaptable yet fundamentally unchanging, the universe could achieve stasis. Not growth, not decay, but eternal, perfect, equilibrium, the cessation of death itself. the implications staggered me you would make all life uniform a single entity spread across reality i already have begun grandfather said his smile returning every plague i release is not merely a disease but a brushstroke in a galaxy-spanning portrait Each epidemic brings its victims one step closer to the perfect form. Each cycle of infection and recovery alters the fundamental nature of all it touches, preparing mortal flesh for the final transformation. He placed the droplet back into the cauldron with surprising tenderness. The patterns you discovered, my counter, are the evidence of my great work. The symmetries that repeat across all plagues are not coincidences." They are the guidelines, the blueprint for the eventual unity of all flesh. I should have been overjoyed. To learn that our work had such profound purpose that grandfather's plan was not merely destruction but salvation of a kind. And yet, something troubled me deeply. But grandfather, I asked. If all becomes one, uniform and unchanging, what then of consciousness, what of identity? What of the very suffering and joy that give meaning to existence? Grandfather's expression did not change, but I sensed a subtle shift in his demeanor. The atmosphere in the mansion grew heavier, the air more thick with spores. Such concerns are luxuries of individuals, he said. Individuals die. The collective persists. In my new order, there will be no need for the pain of self-awareness. Only perfect, eternal existence." Without thought? I pressed, perhaps unwisely. Without experience? Without loss, grandfather counted. Without fear. Without the terror of ending, the mortal condition is defined by death, epidemius. Remove death, and mortality itself becomes meaningless. What I offer is not life as mortals understand it, but something far greater. perpetuity. I bowed my head, accepting his wisdom as I always had. But inside, doubts festered. Like a newly planted contagion, was stasis truly preferable to the cycle of life and death? Was uniformity an acceptable price for eternity? These were dangerous thoughts, heretical thoughts. I buried them deep beneath layers of devotion and duty. I was grandfather's tallykeeper, I would continue to record his great work, to count the souls brought into his embrace, to document the slow, inexorable conversion of all life into his singular vision. But the seed of doubt had been planted, and in the garden all seeds eventually grow. I returned to my duties with renewed dedication, if not enthusiasm. I travelled the length and breadth of the garden, counting the victims of new plagues, recording the successes and occasional failures of grandfather's experiments. But now I saw them with new eyes. Each contagion was not merely a disease, but a vector for fundamental change. Each symptom not just suffering, but transformation. Each death not an end, but a conversion. The universe was being remade one infection at a time, and I was the accountant of its metamorphosis. Months passed in the garden, which might have been centuries in the mortal realm. Time flows differently in the warp, stretching and compressing according to the whims of the gods. I continued my tallying, but with each new count, my disquiet grew. I began to see the pattern not just in the plagues themselves, but in their recipients." The victims of Grandfather's diseases were changing in subtle but profound ways. Species that should have been fundamentally different were beginning to display similar traits after recovery. Biological functions across vastly divergent organisms were standardizing. The universe was homogenizing, just as Grandfather had intended. And yet, the cost of this homogenization was becoming increasingly apparent. As species grew more similar, their unique cultural and biological adaptations vanished. languages died out art forms ceased ways of thinking and perceiving that had evolved over millions of years disappeared in a single generation the universe was not simply changing it was flattening simplifying becoming less i kept these observations to myself recording them in a separate scroll that i hid within the folds of my rotting flesh if grandfather knew of my concerns he gave no indication perhaps he believed that i like all his children would eventually see the wisdom in his grand design or perhaps he simply did not care what any individual thought of his plan so long as we continued to serve but i was not the only one who had noticed the pattern During my travels through the garden, I encountered Kugath again. The great plague-bearer was no longer the jovial, carefree entity I had known. His massive form seemed diminished somehow, his usual retinue of nurglings notably absent. We met in a quiet grove where the trees wept a thick, viscous fluid that smelled of regret. Kugath was collecting samples in vials made from the hollowed out, skulls of space marines. You have seen it too, he said without preamble, not even looking up from his work. It was not a question. The convergence, I replied simply. The homogenization. Kugath nodded, his bloated head swaying on a neck too thin to support it. It is happening faster now. The new plagues are more efficient than ever. The prototype in the cauldron grows more perfect with each passing day. I looked around carefully before speaking again. In the garden, one can never be certain who might be listening. The walls have ears. The ground has eyes. The very air carries whispers back to its master. Are we the only ones who have noticed? I asked. Kugath finally looked up at me, his many eyes blinking in sequence. No, others have seen. The beasts of Nergal grow restless. They sense that their playmates are becoming too similar, too predictable. Several great unclean ones have expressed concerns, though not directly to Grandfather. Even some of the plague-bearers have, and begun to question, though they dare not speak it aloud. This surprised me. Plague-bearers are not known for independent thought. We are created to serve specific functions within Grandfather's realm. That some of my brethren were developing doubts suggested that the wrongness of the situation was more apparent than I had realized. Thank you. What does this mean for us? I asked. For the garden? For grandfather's plan? Kugath sighed, a sound-like wind whistling through a decomposing carcass. It means nothing. We are but instruments of his will. If his will is to reduce the universe to a single, undifferentiated mass of living tissue, then that is what shall come to pass. Our doubts are meaningless against his certainty." But I was not satisfied with this answer. I had served grandfather loyally since my creation. I had counted every death, recorded every plague, documented every triumph of rot over cleanliness. I believed in his vision of a universe embraced by his generous corruption, but this new understanding of his true plan troubled me on a fundamental level. There must be purpose to consciousness, I insisted. To individuality. Why else would the universe have evolved such complexity in the first place? Kugath looked at me with something approaching pity. Purpose? There is no purpose, little counter. There is only what is, and what will be. The universe did not evolve complexity for a reason. It simply happened, a temporary aberration in the long descent into uniformity. Grandfather merely accelerates the inevitable. I cannot accept that, I said, surprising myself with my vehemence." The joy grandfather takes in his work, the care he shows his children, the delight he finds in the suffering and release of mortals. These things require complexity to exist. If all becomes one, undifferentiated mass, what place is there for such experiences? What place for grandfather himself? Kugath had no answer. He simply returned to his collection, carefully extracting drops of fluid from the weeping trees. But I could tell my words had affected him. His movements were less certain, his massive hands trembling slightly as they worked. I left him there, continuing my rounds through the garden. But my conversation with Kugath had crystallized something within me, a resolution, a decision that, once made, could never be unmade. I would have to warn the mortal realm about what was coming. The idea was heretical, treasonous beyond measure. To actively work against Grandfather's plan was unthinkable for any daemon of Nergal, let alone one as favored as myself. And yet, I could not shake the conviction that what was happening was wrong. Not immoral, Grandfather's realm exists beyond such simplistic concepts, but fundamentally incorrect." A mistake in the cosmic order. But how could I, a daemon of the warp, possibly communicate with the mortal realm? The barriers between realities are not easily crossed. Grandfather's plagues could make the journey through vectors like contaminated ships or infected travelers, but information alone. How could I send a message that would be understood and not simply manifest as another contagion? The answer came to me as I was tallying the deaths from a particularly virulent brain fever on the world of epistolarks. The victims of the fever experienced vivid hallucinations before death, many of them identical across individuals who had never met. They reported visions of a garden of impossible plants, of creatures that defied description, of a massive, laughing presence that offered them relief from their pain. They were seeing the garden, seeing grandfather. The fever had created a temporary psychic link between the mortal realm and the warp, a bridge across which information could flow. If I could find a similar vector, or better yet, create one, I might be able to send my warning. I needed a plague of my own. Not one of grandfather's carefully designed transformative diseases, but something new. Something that would carry not physical changes but ideas. Information. Warning. The audacity of the plan should have terrified me. To create a plague without grandfather's blessing was unheard of. To design one specifically to undermine his grand design was worse than heretical. It was betrayal. And yet, I could not stop myself. Using my knowledge of grandfather's patterns, gained through eons of careful observation and recording, I began to formulate my own disease. It would target the mind rather than the body, spreading through physical contact, but manifesting as dreams, visions, sudden intuitive leaps. Those infected would understand on some level what was happening to the universe. They would see the pattern of convergence, recognize the danger of homogenization. They would resist. I worked in secret, using remote corners of the garden where even grandfather's attention rarely fell. I collected samples of existing plagues, modified them, refined them, tested them on captured, souls and lesser daemons. Most of my subjects died, their forms unable to contain the knowledge I was attempting to impart. Others went mad, their minds shattered by glimpses of the truth. But a few, a precious few, understood. I could see it in their eyes, in the way they looked at me afterward, not with the usual fear or reverence, but with recognition, collaboration. My work did not go unnoticed, of course. Nothing in the garden truly escapes grandfather's awareness, but he did not stop me. Perhaps he was curious to see what I would create. Perhaps he was confident that nothing I could do would significantly impact his grand design. Or perhaps he understood, on some level, that the doubt I represented was a necessary component of the universe he sought to preserve. Complexity requires conflict. After all, months passed, or years, or centuries. Time meant nothing as I refined my creation. My fellow plague-bearers began to avoid me. The nurglings that had once followed me in playful... Swarms now scattered at my approach. Even the landscape of the garden seemed to shift away from me, paths that had once welcomed my tread now becoming treacherous or disappearing entirely. I was becoming anathema to the very realm I had served for so long. The irony was not lost on me. Finally, my work was complete. I had created a plague unlike any other in Grandfather's arsenal. It had no physical symptoms beyond a slight fever and enhanced dream states, making it nearly impossible to detect until it had spread throughout an entire population. There were no postules, no bleeding, no visible corruption of flesh. Only a subtle warming of the skin, easily dismissed as emotional excitement or mild exertion, and dreams so vivid, so compelling, that those infected would wake with tears in their eyes, though they could rarely articulate why. What made the Illuminating Pox truly unique was its method of infection. Unlike conventional diseases that targeted the body, this plague infected consciousness itself. It rewrote the neural pathways through which sentient beings processed information, subtly altering their perception to allow them to see what I had seen. The patterns, the symmetries, the evidence of grandfather's true design hidden within the apparent chaos of existence. It spread through touch, through shared food and drink, through close conversation, the altered consciousness of the infected subtly influencing those around them through microscopic changes in behavior in thought patterns in the very words they chose to express themselves but its true transmission was memetic the carrier of ideas rather than bacteria one infected individual could through nothing more than conversation plant the seeds of illumination in dozens of others Those seeds would grow, blossom, and in turn produce seeds of their own. What began as a vague suspicion in one mind would become a revelation shared by an entire society. The knowledge would spread exponentially, unstoppably, a contagion of awareness that no quarantine could contain, no medicine could cure. For how does one inoculate against truth? How does one develop resistance to reality? I called it the Illuminating Pox, for it revealed the truth that lay beneath the surface of reality. And in that revelation, I hoped, lay the salvation of consciousness itself. Now I needed only to introduce it to the mortal realm. A task far easier said than done for a demon bound to the garden. Fortune, if such a concept has meaning in the timeless chaos of the warp, provided my opportunity. A warband of the Death Guard, mortal space marines devoted to grandfather's service, had entered the garden to receive new blessings before embarking on a campaign against the Imperium. They would make perfect carriers for my plague. I arranged to be present when grandfather bestowed his gifts upon them, standing among the other plague-bearers as witnesses to his generosity. The ceremony took place in the heart of the garden, before the rotting mansion itself. The space marines knelt in the muck, their armor already showing signs of corruption, their flesh visible through gaps in the ceramite hosting a dozen different diseases. Their leader, a hulking figure whose armor had become almost completely fused with his diseased flesh, stepped forward to receive Grandfather's personal blessing. This was my moment. As the ritual reached its climax, as Grandfather's attention was focused on imbuing the champion with a particularly complex cocktail of contagions, I moved. It was a small thing. A touch, the lightest brush of my rotting hand against the ceramite shoulder guard of one of the kneeling Marines, none noticed. None but the Marine himself, who turned slightly at the contact. Our eyes met briefly, his clouded with cataracts but still alert within the bloated folds of his face. For an instant, I feared he would cry out, would expose my treachery. but he did not. Perhaps he felt the fever of the illuminating pox already beginning to take hold. Perhaps he glimpsed, in that brief contact, something of what I was attempting to do. Whatever the reason, he simply nodded, the gesture almost imperceptible, before turning his attention back to the ceremony. It was done. My plague was loose in a vector that would soon return to the mortal realm. What would happen next was beyond my control. Would the marine spread the infection as intended? Would those affected understand the warning contained within their fevered dreams? Would any mortal mind be capable of comprehending the true nature of Grandfather's plan? I did not know. I could not know. All I could do was return to my duties and wait. I did not have to wait long. The change was subtle at first, new tallies arriving from the mortal realm showing slight variations in the expected patterns, plagues that should have followed grandfather's carefully designed progression, showing unexpected mutations, victims displaying symptoms that had not been part of the original design, species developing immunities where none should have been possible, recoveries occurring in populations marked for extinction. Each deviation was minor when viewed in isolation, a plague taking three days longer to reach saturation on an agri-world, a hive city developing a folk remedy that reduced mortality by a fraction of a percent. a regiment of imperial guard surviving exposure to a miasma that should have liquefied their organs but together they formed a pattern of their own a counterpoint to grandfather's grand symphony of infection a dissonance in what should have been perfect harmony the illuminating pox was working not as a direct counter to grandfather's plagues it was far too weak for that but as a catalyst for change for divergence Those infected were not just passively accepting their role in the Great Convergence. They were fighting back, their bodies and minds finding new ways to resist the homogenization. On Tartarus, Secundus, a Medicaid researcher infected with the pox, developed a vaccine that temporarily halted the progression of the weeping, a plague that should have claimed the entire population within a month. The vaccine ultimately failed, the weeping adapting to overcome it, but not before thousands had been permanently altered by the combination of the vaccine and the disease, their biology taking a different evolutionary path than grandfather had designed. In the underhives of Necromunda, gangs exposed to both the illuminating pox and the red thirst began using the symptoms of the latter as combat stimulants, deliberately infecting themselves before raids, then purging their systems with dangerous chemical cocktails before the disease could progress to its terminal stage. The survivors emerged changed, their bodies hosting unique variations of the red thirst that bore little resemblance to the original strain. Most significantly, on the forge world of Grya, a tech priest infected with the Lod. Pox analyzed the pattern of machine failures caused by the Rust Plague, identifying the mathematical sequence underlying the contagion. Using this knowledge, he recalibrated the Forge World's defense systems to project a counter-frequency, creating a shield that, while it could not prevent infection entirely, slowed its progress by nearly 60%, giving the inhabitants precious time to evacuate before the planet was consumed. It was a small victory, but a victory nonetheless. A proof that complexity could reassert itself against the crushing weight of uniformity. That consciousness, individuality, the very aspects of existence that gave it meaning, could persist. My satisfaction was short-lived, I was tallying the victims of a blood flux on a feudal world when I felt it. A presence, a weight of attention so vast it threatened to crush me where I stood. I did not need to turn to know who had found me. But I turned anyway, prostrating myself in the bloody mud of the battlefield, where I had been counting. Grandfather loomed above me, so vast that he blotted out the sky, his former mountain of rotting flesh and vibrant disease. His face, what could be seen of it, was set in an expression I had never witnessed before. Not anger, not disappointment, something far worse. Consideration. My faithful counter, he said, his voice the sound of civilizations collapsing into dust. My diligent recorder, my betrayer, I had no defense to offer, no justification that would satisfy him. So I offered only truth. I could not allow it, grandfather. I said, my voice steady despite the terror that threatened to overwhelm me. the convergence, the flattening of all complexity into undifferentiated sameness. It is wrong. Wrong? Grandfather repeated, the words stretching and distorting in his mouth. What is right or wrong to us, Damon? We are beyond such childish concepts. We are the truth of existence manifest. The inevitable made conscious. Not this truth, I insisted, rising slowly from my prostration to face him directly. A final act of defiance. Not this inevitability. The universe tends toward complexity, not simplicity, toward diversity, not uniformity. Your plan denies the fundamental nature of reality. Grandfather laughed, the sound causing the very ground beneath us to ripple and shift. You presume to lecture me on the nature of reality. I who have existed since the first living thing feared its own mortality, I who have watched civilizations rise and fall like waves upon a shore. He reached down, one massive finger extended toward me. I did not flinch, did not try to escape. There was nowhere in all of creation where I could hide from him. The finger touched my forehead gentle despite its enormous size. You have always been different from your brethren Epidemias. More curious. More questioning. It is why I made you my tally keeper. To count requires discernment, judgment, the ability to recognize patterns. I gave you these gifts, knowing they might one day lead you to this moment. I stared up at him, uncomprehending. You knew? You expected my betrayal? Grandfather's laughter rolled across the battlefield again, causing the corpses to shudder as if attempting to rise. Betrayal? Is that what you think this is? Oh, my faithful, foolish counter. This is not betrayal. This is purpose. Your purpose. The purpose I designed for you from the moment of your creation. Understanding dawned slowly, horribly. I am part of the plan, I whispered. My resistance, my doubt, my warning to the mortal realm. All of it planned." "'Of course,' Grandfather said. His voice almost gentle now. "'What is stability without challenge? What is uniformity without the contrast of diversity? What is eternity without the memory of change? Your illuminating pox is not a disruption of my grand design. It is a crucial component,' he straightened, his massive form swaying like a colossus above me. The mortal realm must fight the convergence, must struggle against the homogenization. Their resistance strengthens the final form, makes it more resilient, more complete. A universe that surrendered too easily to transformation would be fundamentally flawed, weak, unsuited for eternity. The revelation crushed me more thoroughly than any physical punishment could have. My defiance, my grand betrayal, had been nothing more than another brushstroke in Grandfather's cosmic portrait. My free will, an illusion, my resistance incorporated into his plan before I had even conceived of it. What happens now? I asked, my voice hollow. Now? Grandfather's smile widened impossibly, splitting his face almost in half to reveal rows of rotting teeth the size of battle tanks. Now you continue your work, my faithful counter. You spread your little plague of illumination, you foster resistance, you count the struggle and the suffering it creates, and in the end, you will count the final victory of stability over chaos, of eternity over transience. He began to fade, his massive form becoming translucent, then transparent, until only his voice remained, echoing across the battlefield. After all, what is a good story without conflict, what is triumph without struggle? Count well my epidemius. Count every death, every transformation, every act of resistance. Count the cost of eternity. And then he was gone, leaving me alone among the dead. My tally scroll clutched in trembling hands. I understood then the true horror of Grandfather's plan, not just the elimination of diversity, of complexity, of consciousness itself, but the incorporation of resistance into the plan, the perversion of free will into just another cog in the great machine of convergence. There was no fighting it, no escape. Even the struggle against homogenization was part of the homogenization process. I returned to my duties with new understanding, counting the dead, recording the spread of grandfather's plagues, noting the subtle variations, introduced by my own illuminating pox. I watched as mortal civilizations recognized the pattern, as they developed countermeasures, as they fought with increasing desperation against the slow, inexorable conversion of all life into grandfather's singular vision, I counted their victories, small and temporary though they were. I counted their defeats, massive and devastating and final. I counted the slow transformation of the galaxy, one plague at a time, into something less diverse, less complex, less alive. and I counted my own complicity in this cosmic tragedy. For I continued to spread the illuminating pox at every opportunity, continued to foster resistance, continued to create the very conflict that grandfather had declared necessary for his plan. I could not stop myself. the compulsion was built into my very nature a daemon created for a specific purpose fulfilling that purpose despite understanding its ultimate futility centuries passed in the mortal realm millennia the pattern of convergence accelerated Species after species succumbed to grandfather's plagues, their survivors changed in subtle but profound ways. The homogenization was visible now even to mortal eyes, impossible to deny or dismiss as coincidence. The Imperium of Man, ever paranoid, ever vigilant against the corrupting influence of chaos, recognized the threat too late. By the time their inquisitors had compiled enough evidence to present to the high lords of terror, the process was already too advanced to stop. Billions had been exposed, trillions were already changing, other forces in the galaxy fared no better. The Eldar, with their advanced biology and psychic sensitivity, detected the pattern early, but their limited numbers and isolated enclaves made coordinated resistance impossible. The Orcs, paradoxically, proved the most resistant due to their simplified biology and psychological makeup. But even they began to show signs of the convergence after exposure to enough of grandfather's specially tailored plagues. The Tao, young and adaptable, mounted perhaps the most effective resistance, using their advanced medical technology to identify and counteract the subtle changes wrought by infection. But they were too few, too concentrated in a small region of the galaxy to turn the tide. And through it all, I counted, every infection, every death, every subtle shift in the biological and psychological makeup of the galaxy's inhabitants, My tally scrolls filled with names and numbers beyond comprehension, a record of the greatest transformation in the history of creation. I was there when the first truly hybrid forms began to appear, creatures that could no longer be classified as human or Eldar or Ork or any other recognized species, beings whose cellular structure contained elements of dozens of different biological lineages, all functioning together in perfect harmony. The early stages of grandfather's new organism, the singular entity that would eventually encompass all life in the galaxy, I counted them too. Watched their numbers grow from isolated incidents to significant populations, observed as they began to establish their own societies, their own cultures, primitive and simplified but recognizable. the embryonic form of what all consciousness would eventually become, and still my illuminating pox spread, carried now by dedicated cults who believed they were fighting against grandfather's plan even as they unwittingly served it. They called themselves the enlightened, the aware, the resistors, They fought with desperate courage against the forces of convergence, using the enhanced understanding granted by the fever to develop new medicines, new technologies, new strategies. They died in their billions, their corpses feeding the very process they sought to stop. I counted them all, each name a weight upon whatever passed for my soul. The galaxy burned with conflict, war on a scale unseen since the Horus heresy. Every faction, every species, every individual fighting to maintain their unique identity against the rising tide of homogenization. Violence reached apocalyptic proportions, entire systems destroyed in desperate attempts to halt the spread of infection. It was exactly as grandfather had planned. The conflict, the struggle, the resistance, all served to strengthen the final form, to make it more resilient, more adaptable, more complete. I witnessed the fall of terror, not to armies or fleets, but to a plague so subtle that no one recognized its presence until more than half the population had been converted. The god-emperor himself, sustained in undeath by his golden throne, was perhaps the only being on the planet to remain unchanged, his rotting form already so altered by millennia of decay that even grandfather's most potent contagions found nothing left to transform. I counted the evacuation fleets, the refugee ships, the last desperate attempts to preserve some fragment of humanity in its original form. Most failed. Some succeeded, establishing isolated colonies in the furthest reaches of the galaxy, buying themselves a few more generations of individuality before the inevitable found them too. Through it all, the hybrid forms continued to spread, to grow, to evolve, along grandfather's carefully designed path. They established their own empire amid the ruins of a dozen others, a civilization unlike any the galaxy had seen before. Not human or alien, but something new, something unified despite the incredible diversity of their biological origins. They called themselves the harmonious, though the name varied in their many dialects. Their society was neither utopian nor dystopian but something stranger, a collectivist structure in which individual consciousness remained but was subservient to the needs and desires of the whole. They did not conquer. They simply absorbed, converted, transformed. I watched them with fascination and horror. They were the future of all, life in the galaxy, the blueprint for what every conscious being would eventually become, and they were, in many ways, magnificent. Their resistance to disease was absolute, their adaptability unmatched, their technological and psychic capabilities enhanced by the incredible diversity of their genetic makeup, but they were also diminished. The unique perspectives, the cultural richness, the sheer creative potential of a galaxy filled with truly different forms of intelligence was being sacrificed for survival and stability. The wild, chaotic beauty of diversity replaced by the careful, managed aesthetic of controlled variation. I counted their victories and their setbacks. I recorded their steady expansion across the galaxy, I tallied the last populations of pure humans, pure Eldar, pure Orcs, as their numbers dwindled from billions to millions to thousands. And I continued to spread my illuminating pox, continued to foster resistance, continued to create the conflict that grandfather had declared necessary for his plan. The compulsion was still there, built into my nature, impossible to deny. But now I understood its true purpose, its place in the grand design. My plague was not a warning, it was a catalyst, not for resistance, but for the very transformation it purported to fight against. The knowledge it granted, the understanding of the pattern, only served to intensify the conflict, to strengthen the final form through opposition. I was the unwitting architect of the very future I had tried to prevent. The realization should have broken me. Perhaps it did. It becomes difficult to distinguish between wholeness and brokenness when one's entire existence is revealed as a carefully designed cog in a cosmic machine. I continued my duties, counting, recording, spreading my plague, but something fundamental had changed within me. I began to see beyond the tallies, beyond the numbers, beyond the grand pattern of convergence. I began to notice the small acts of defiance, the tiny moments of individuality that persisted even in the face of overwhelming homogenization, a hybrid who composed music that reflected their Eldar heritage, a converted human who maintained rituals from their former life. an altered orc who found new ways to express their innate love of violence within the constraints of the harmonious society. These were not disruptions to grandfather's plan. They were too small, too insignificant to impact the grand design. But they were real. They were genuine expressions of the complexity that the universe naturally tends toward, assertions of identity in the face of uniformity, and in these small acts of defiance, these tiny flames of individuality, I found something I had thought lost forever. Hope, not for victory against grandfather's plan, that was impossible, but for the preservation of meaning within it, for the continuation of experience, of consciousness, of the very aspects of existence that gave it value, I began to foster these moments whenever I could, subtly encouraging the hybrids I encountered to maintain connections to their original cultures, to preserve fragments of the diversity that was being sacrificed. It was not resistance to the plan, it was adaptation within it, finding space for meaning in a universe trending toward uniformity. Grandfather, if he noticed my new approach, gave no sign. Perhaps it too was part of his design, another layer of complexity in the grand pattern. Perhaps he understood that true stability required not just physical homogenization but psychological acceptance, that his new universal organism would need some sense of its diverse origins to function properly. Or perhaps, and this thought was so heretical that I dared not dwell on it for long, perhaps grandfather himself was not the ultimate architect of reality." Perhaps he too was a cog in a machine beyond even his comprehension, a force of nature playing out its role in the cosmic drama just as I played. Mine. The transformation of the galaxy continued. Centuries became millennia. The Harmonious expanded beyond the boundaries of the Milky Way, sending colony ships to neighboring galaxies, spreading grandfather's vision across the cosmos. The last pockets of original species died out. Their unique biologies finally absorbed into the great collective, their cultures preserved only in the fragmentary memories of their transformed descendants. I counted it all. Every infection, every conversion, every extinction, My Tally Scrolls became a record of the greatest transformation in the history of creation, a document that no one would ever read, but that contained within it the story of how diversity became unity, how complexity became simplicity, how chaos became order. And still I spread my illuminating pox, now not as resistance but as remembrance. A fever that granted not just understanding of the pattern but appreciation for what had been lost, what had been sacrificed for eternity. A memorial plague, carrying the memories of a galaxy that had once contained multitudes. In the end, is that not the best we can hope for? Not to prevent loss, but to remember what was lost. not to halt change, but to carry forward the meaning of what came before. I am Magister Epidemius, the Tally Keeper, Chief Plague Bearer of Grandfather Nurgle, and I have counted every death brought about by his loving hand since time immemorial. I have recorded the greatest transformation in the history of creation. I have witnessed the birth of a new order, a singular organism spread across reality, undying, unchanging, eternal, and in my counting, in my recording, in my witnessing, I have preserved something of what came before. The multitudes, the complexity, the glorious chaotic diversity of a universe unbound by singular purpose. Perhaps that, ultimately, is my true function in grandfather's grand design. Not just to count the transformation, but to remember what was transformed, to carry forward the meaning that might otherwise be lost. For what is eternity without memory? What is stability without the knowledge of change? What is unity without appreciation for the diverse elements that compose it? I continue my duties, I count, I record, I remember, and in that remembrance I find purpose beyond the compulsion built into my nature. I find meaning in a universe trending toward meaninglessness. Is it enough? I do not know. Cannot know. I am but one daemon, playing my small part in a drama beyond comprehension. But it is what I have, what I am, what I will continue to be until the last star burns out, and even Grandfather's eternal garden finally withers and dies. Count well, he told me. Count every death, every transformation, every act of resistance, count the cost of eternity, And I have, oh how I have.

The horrifying life of Damon Princes is not what you imagine. I remember the weight of mortality, the simple certainty of an ending, how foolish I was to fear it. I traded my humanity for godhood, for freedom from death's grasp. Now my flesh burns and reforms with every sunrise, my mind twists between false grandeur and crushing servitude. My victories are not my own. My will bends to powers I once thought I could control. I command armies across burning stars one moment, then writhe in chains of living fire the next. They call me immortal, but can you truly live when you belong to another? They call me a prince, but what ruler wears a crown that causes only pain? What I gained in power, I lost in something far more precious, something you still possess. Would you make the bargain I made if you knew the true price of eternity? I was once a warrior of the word-bearer's legion. My name then is irrelevant, stripped from me as thoroughly as my humanity. I served during the Great Crusade, faithfully bringing worlds into compliance for an emperor I believed would lead mankind to glory among the stars. When Lorgar turned his gaze from the false emperor to the true powers that rule the cosmos, I followed, not out of blind obedience, but conviction. The gods of chaos offered truth in a universe built on imperial lies. They promised power to those with the courage to seize it. and I was nothing if not courageous. For two centuries I fought in the long war, I led raiding parties into real space, commanded warships that burned agri-worlds to ash, and offered the screams of billions to the dark gods. With each atrocity, I felt their gaze upon me more intently, their whispers grew more distinct in my dreams promises of glory of ascension of freedom from the weaknesses of flesh i listened i believed the anointing as we called it occurred on a world whose name is now lost to time an insignificant imperial colony on the fringes of ultramar Its only value was symbolic, a world claimed by the sons of Giliman. We descended upon it like a storm, not to conquer, but to desecrate, to transform it into a ritual site that would draw the eye of the gods. For seven days and nights, my warriors and I enacted the grand ritual. We raised eight spires of flayed corpses around the governor's palace, each aligned to channel the energies of the warp. The population was not simply slaughtered, but used. Each death was carefully choreographed, each scream a specific note in a symphony of suffering that would echo into the immaterial. Blood ran in geometric patterns through the streets, forming sigils visible only from orbit. The planet itself became an altar. On the final night, as the veil between real space and the warp grew tissue thin, I stood at the center of it all. My armor was inscribed with blasphemous runes that burned my flesh even through the ceramite. My helmet was discarded, my face turned upward to witness the roiling storm clouds that had gathered above. Lightning struck the spires in perfect sequence, and the veil tore open. What stepped through was not a god, but a herald, a greater daemon of Tziench, Lord of Change. Its form shifted constantly, iridescent feathers melting into scales, then crystalline structures, then back again. Its many eyes regarded me with what I mistook for respect. When it spoke, its voice was a thousand whispers in my mind. The changer of ways has marked you, mortal. Your ambition pleases him. Your cunning amuses him. Your potential intrigues him. Are you willing to shed the last vestiges of your humanity to serve eternally in his legion of the changed? Without hesitation, I said yes. Without understanding what I was agreeing to, I surrendered everything. The daemon's laughter was the last thing I heard with mortal ears. Its talons pierced my chest, not to kill but to transform. My body erupted in blue flame that consumed flesh but not consciousness. I felt every moment of my unmaking, every cell torn, apart and reshaped according to the whims of a god whose plans I could not comprehend. My skull elongated, my spine twisted and multiplied, my limbs stretched and reformed, extra appendages burst from my torso. My skin hardened into plates in some places, became translucent in others, revealing organs that no longer functioned as they should. The pain was beyond description, beyond sanity. Not because it was intense, though it was, but because it was wrong. It moved in directions that pain should not move. It had tastes and colors and sounds. It existed in dimensions that the human mind cannot perceive. And then, suddenly, it stopped. I stood taller, stronger, remade. Power coursed through what remained of my veins. Reality itself seemed malleable around me. I could see the currents of the warp, the threads of fate and possibility. I could hear the thoughts of my followers as they prostrated themselves before me. I laughed, and the sound shattered the crystallized tears of those who had been weeping when the ritual began. For a moment, one perfect moment, I believed I had won. That I had transcended mortality and joined the ranks of the divine. That I was free, I was wrong, so terribly, cosmically wrong. The first indication came minutes later, as the daemon that had transformed me regarded me with its kaleidoscopic eyes. I tried to speak to thank my patron for this gift, but found my mouth would not form the words I intended. Instead, I heard myself pledge eternal servitude in ways far more binding than any oath I had ever made as a mortal. It was not that I was being forced to speak these words, it was that the desire to speak them had been woven into the fabric of my new being. my will was still my own but my will itself had been remade the daemon nodded satisfied and gestured to a swirling portal behind it your first task awaits prince of change do not disappoint your master i stepped through without question not because i was compelled but because i could not conceive of doing otherwise and thus began my existence as zytherian daemon prince of tziench eternally bound to the will of the god of change what followed was a period of what i can only describe as intoxication the power was real, as was the near immortality. I led warbands through the eye of terror, commanding legions of daemons and corrupted Astartes. I unmade reality around me, reshaping it according to my whims, I dueled champions of the Imperium and left their corpses as twisted monuments to change. Through it all, I believed myself to be acting of my own volition, pursuing my own desires for conquest and revenge against the false emperor. It took decades before I began to notice the patterns, the subtle nudges in my thoughts, the convenient alignments of my desires with the incomprehensible schemes of Tziench. By then, it was far too late. The hooks were set too deep. I was a puppet who had been granted the illusion of freedom, allowed to see my strings but never to cut them. And then came the first remaking. I had failed in a campaign against a particularly stubborn imperial world, not a significant failure in the grand scheme, merely a minor setback in an eternal war. But it displeased my patron. I was meditating in my chambers aboard my flagship when the pain began again. Not the transformative agony of my initial ascension, but something more deliberate, more personal. My form began to shift and change without my consent. Additional limbs burst from my torso only to be reabsorbed. My skin cycled through textures and colors. My internal organs rearranged themselves in configurations that would have killed a mortal instantly. For what felt like years, though it may have been only hours in real space, I was unmade and remade according to the whims of Tsinch. When it finally ended, I bore little resemblance to the form I had grown accustomed to. My reflection in the polished surface of my armor showed a stranger. A grotesque fusion of avian and reptilian features, with too many eyes, and a crown of crystalline horns. The message was clear. I was not my own. Even my form was merely on loan, subject to revision or revocation at any time. I existed at the pleasure of my God, and that pleasure was capricious. This has been my existence ever since. Periods of relative autonomy punctuated by brutal reminders of my true status. I have been reshaped more times than I can count. Each transformation a lesson in humility, each new form a canvas for Tsing to express his ever-changing whims. There are days when I command armies that span the stars, when mortals and immortals alike tremble at my approach. There are also days when I am little more than a messenger, carrying obscure communications between greater demons whose machinations dwarf my own. There is no consistency, no reliable pattern to my status. Xiege elevates or diminishes me according to plans I can never fully comprehend, and always, always, there is the knowledge that true freedom is forever beyond my reach. I traded one master for another, and my new master is infinitely more demanding, infinitely more invasive, infinitely more cruel in his capricious attention. This is the truth that no aspirant to daemonhood can understand until it is too late. Ascension is not freedom. It is the forging of chains that can never be broken, the acceptance of a collar that can never be removed. We who were once mortal champions, who believed ourselves worthy of Godhood, have become little more than extensions of our patron's will. Our victories are their victories. Our suffering is their entertainment. Our eternal existence is neither a reward nor a punishment, but simply a tool to be used in the great game. I share this truth not in hope of sympathy or understanding. Such concepts are meaningless in the realm where I now primarily exist. I share it as a warning that will go unheeded, as all such warnings have since the dawn of time. The path to power, through chaos, is a road that leads to only one destination, regardless of which god you pledge yourself to, and that destination is servitude more absolute than any mortal slave has ever known. Remember this, if you remember nothing else. In the court of the dark gods, even the princes are merely pawns. Let me tell you of my first campaign as a daemon prince. The world was called Sarix V, a forge-world of moderate importance to the Imperium. Its primary export was ammunition for bolters, a mundane yet vital product that kept the guns of the Adeptus Astartes firing across a hundred war zones. Not a prestigious target, but one whose loss would be felt acutely across multiple sectors. My invasion was not merely an act of war, it was a ritual in itself. Each move of my forces corresponded to a specific constellation in the ever-shifting heavens of the warp. Each defensive position I allowed the Imperials to maintain represented a node in a grand spell that would culminate in the world's transformation. I understood this on an instinctive level. The knowledge had been woven into my being during my ascension. The imperial defenders fought with the desperate courage of men who know they are doomed. Skittari regiments marched in perfect lockstep to their deaths. Tech priests turned industrial machinery into improvised weapons of war. Even the civilian workforce took up arms, wielding welding torches and industrial hammers against my demonic legions. Their resistance was futile, but I admired their tenacity. It reminded me of what I had once been, of the mortality I had surrendered. On the 49th day of the siege, I entered the Central Forge complex personally, The heat was intense enough to melt ceramite, but my new form found it invigorating. The air was thick with the scent of molten metal, promethium, and fear. Servitors continued to work the assembly lines even as battles raged around them. Their programming too limited to recognize the chaos that had engulfed their world. At the heart of the complex, I found the Archmagos, He was ancient even by the standards of the Mechanicus, more machine than man, with only a single Romii and a few scraps of withered flesh to indicate that he had ever been human at all. He stood before a towering reactor core, his mechadendrites interfaced directly with its controls. I know what you intend, he said, his voice a metallic rasp. You will not succeed, abomination. I laughed, and the sound caused the lesser tech priests around him to clutch at their augmatic ears in pain. You understand nothing, servant of the false machine God. Your comprehension is limited by the physical universe. I see beyond such constraints. Perhaps, the Archmagos replied, but I understand enough to deny you your prize. Before I could react, he triggered the reactor's overload sequence. The chamber was instantly flooded with radiation that would have killed any mortal instantly. The tech priests around him collapsed, their flesh sloughing off their bones even as their augmetics sparked and failed. But the old magos remained standing, protected by some ancient technology that even I could not identify. I felt the radiation pass through my demonic form, It could not harm me directly, but it disrupted the careful ritual I had been enacting across the planet. The constellation I had been forming with my troop movements was now misaligned. The spell was unraveling. Rage filled me, a rage beyond anything I had known as a mortal. I lunged forward, my talons extending to impossible lengths, and tore the Archmegos limb from Augmatic limb. His death scream was a binary shriek that echoed through the noosphere of the entire forge world. I scattered his components across the chamber, ensuring that not even the Mechanicus would be able to salvage his memories or experience. But it was too late. The ritual was ruined. And in that moment, I felt the displeasure of my patron like a cold wind blowing through my soul. When I returned to my flagship in orbit, I found a lord of change waiting in my private chambers, not the same entity that had overseen my ascension, but another of Tzienche's greater daemons. It regarded me with eyes that reflected the birth and death of stars. The architect of fate is displeased, it said, its voice the susuration of pages turning in forgotten libraries. The pattern was specific. the ritual precise, you allowed a single mortal to disrupt the grand design. The world is taken, I protested. Its production capacity will now serve the long war. Its population has been slaughtered or corrupted. By any measure, this is victory. Victory, the daemon echoed, the word somehow becoming a mockery in its mouth. Tiench does not desire mere victory. He orchestrates symphonies of change across time and space. Your role was defined. Your performance has been found wanting. I felt it then, the stirring in my flesh, the beginning of another remaking. But this one was different. This one had purpose beyond mere punishment or caprice." My body began to crystallize, starting at my extremities and working inward. My consciousness remained untouched, but my ability to act, to move, to speak was gradually stripped away. you will serve as a monument the lord of change informed me a marker of failure a lesson to others who would disappoint our master perhaps in a century or two if your capacity for innovation has been restored you will be granted mobility once more And so I remained, a living statue aboard my own vessel, watching as command was transferred to one of my lieutenants. I could still see, still hear, still think, but I could not move so much as a finger. My flagship became my prison, my trophy room, and my torture chamber all in one. For sixty-seven years I existed in this state of living death. I watched as my warband continued the long war without me. I witnessed betrayals and power struggles among my former subordinates. I, observed as Imperial strike forces boarded my vessel on three separate occasions, each time being repelled before they could reach my chambers. Through it all, I remained frozen, conscious, silently screaming. The experience changed me more fundamentally than any physical transformation could have. I came to understand the true depth of my servitude. The absolute nature of Tzienchi's control over my existence, the hollow mockery that was my supposed elevation to Daemonhood, I had not ascended. I had been enslaved. When the crystallization finally reversed itself, when I could once again move and speak and command, I was not the same entity that had been frozen. The rage and frustration had crystallized as well, becoming something cold and hard and patient. I understood now that my only path forward was perfect obedience, not the grudging compliance of a conquered foe, but the total sublimation of my will to that of my patron. Only by becoming a perfect instrument of Tsiensh's designs could I avoid such punishment in the future. And so I returned to the long war with renewed purpose. I led my warband in campaigns of such elaborate complexity that even my most intelligent lieutenants could not discern their ultimate goal. We would conquer a world only to abandon it, assassinate an imperial governor only to replace him with a puppet who enacted the same policies, steal artifacts of tremendous power only to discard them in seemingly random locations across the galaxy. All the while, I felt Sienche's approval like the warmth of a distant Sunday. Not consistent, never predictable, but present often enough to assure me that I was serving his ineffable purposes. The remakings continued, but they were less frequent, less painful, more purposeful. My form shifted to suit the needs of each campaign, sometimes subtle, other times dramatic. I became a shapeshifter whose core identity was subsumed by the roles I was required to play, There was a campaign on a shrine world, I, I recall, where I was required to appear as an imperial saint. My demonic nature was concealed beneath an illusion of such perfection that even sisters of battle knelt before me in reverence. I walked among the faithful, blessing them with touches that seemed holy, but actually planted the seeds of corruption in their souls. For three years, I maintained this deception, slowly poisoning the faith of an entire world until the moment came for the veil to drop and the horror to be revealed. The psychic shock of that betrayal tore a wound in reality that swallowed the planet's entire cathedral district, sending thousands of souls screaming directly into the waiting moor of the warp. Tiench was pleased. My reward was a period of relative stability. For nearly a century, I retained a single form, a single identity. I built a power base in the eye of terror. I accumulated knowledge, artifacts, and influence. I began to nurture ambitions of my own once more. It was, of course, another test, another lesson in the nature of my bondage. I had established a stronghold on a daemon world deep within the eye. A twisted labyrinth of a fortress whose corridors rearranged themselves according to my whims, whose walls were inscribed with sorcerous formulae that drove mortal minds to madness, whose very foundations rested upon the crystallized remains of a fallen Eldar craft world. From this base, I directed operations across a dozen sectors of imperial space. My name was whispered in fear by inquisitors. My sigil was a mark of doom recognized even by common imperial citizens. I had achieved a status that few daemon princes ever attain, and then, without warning or apparent cause, it was stripped from me. I awoke one day to find my fortress gone, replaced by a barren plain of blue crystal that stretched to the horizon in every direction. My legions of daemons, my mortal followers, my fellow Chaos Space Marines, all had vanished as if they had never existed. I stood alone, naked and confused, my physical form reduced to something almost human once more. A single figure approached across the plane. A mortal man in simple robes, unremarkable in every way except for his eyes, which swirled with all the colors of change. A prophet of Tseynch, one of the rare human psychas who can commune directly with the God of Change without losing their sanity entirely. The architect of fate has a new design for you, Prince Scytharian, he said, his voice both weary and amused. Your time as a warlord has ended, your time as a wanderer begins. I don't understand, I replied, and it was true. I had served faithfully. I had furthered Sienche's unknowable plans. I had learned the lesson of absolute obedience. What have I done to displease our master? The prophet smiled, and in that smile I saw the fundamental truth of chaos that all its servants eventually learn. Displease? You misunderstand. This is not punishment. This is purpose. You have become too fixed, too static in your role. a daemon prince who settles into patterns is anathema to the lord of change it is not your actions that have brought this about but your very success in them and with that the prophet gestured opening a portal in the air beside him Through it, I could see a world I did not recognize, a battlefield where imperial forces clashed with creatures that resembled tyrannids but moved with unnatural coordination that suggested warp influence. Your new purpose awaits, the Prophet said. Go forth as a wanderer, masterless and unbound, sow chaos in the most literal sense, be unpredictable, be transformative. Break patterns rather than establish them. When you have learned this lesson, perhaps you will be granted a new form of power. or perhaps not. Uncertainty is the only certainty in the service of Tsiench. I had no choice. I stepped through the portal and into my new existence as a nomad, a random element in the grand equations of fate. For centuries, I wandered thus, inserting myself into conflicts across the galaxy, always acting to disrupt rather than to conquer. I became a catalyst for change rather than an agent of any specific design, I abandoned my name, my history, even the consistent physical form that had marked me as Zytherion. In this role, I discovered a different kind of power. Not the obvious authority of a warlord, but the subtle influence of the unexpected variable. I would appear on battlefields where the outcome seemed predetermined, and alter the course of fate with a single well-placed intervention. I would visit imperial worlds on the verge of rebellion, and either quash the uprising or inflame it, depending on which outcome would cause the greater disruption to established patterns. I would whisper truths and lies with equal facility into the ears of the powerful, seeding doubt and ambition and paranoia. Through it all, I felt Tsienchie's attention like a weight, sometimes heavy, sometimes light, but always present. I was performing a role in a play whose script I could not read, whose ending I could not predict, but I had learned enough by then to understand that this was precisely the point. Senge himself does not know how his schemes will unfold. He sets events in motion and delights in their unexpected permutations. My confusion, my uncertainty, my constant adaptation to changing circumstances, all of these were offerings to his fundamental nature. And yet, even in this role of deliberate chaos, I found myself falling into patterns. It is the nature of sentient minds, even demonic ones, to seek structure and meaning. I began to anticipate which battlefields would draw my master's interest. I developed techniques for disruption that I would repeat when circumstances were similar. I created a new identity for myself, a nomadic demon prince known as the Shifter, whose arrival heralded unexpected change. It was, in its own way, another failure to truly understand the nature of my bondage. The realization came. During what mortals call the Obscurous Crusade, I had been drawn to a particular front where the Imperium was making significant gains against a coalition of chaos warbands. My intention was to disrupt the Imperial advance by assassinating a key general, replacing him with a doppelganger who would lead his forces into an ambush. It was a plan I had executed successfully on three previous occasions, with variations to account for different circumstances. A pattern, in other words, but one that had proven effective and unpredictable to my enemies. I had infiltrated the Imperial command structure, assuming the form of a minor officer, I was one level of security away from my target when I felt the familiar, dreaded sensation of a remaking begin. My carefully crafted human disguise began to melt away, revealing my demonic nature in the middle of an imperial command post. Dozens of officers and stormtroopers turned toward me, their expressions shifting from confusion to horror. Lasguns were raised, orders were shouted, and i who had planned this operation with such care found myself revealed by my own master's whim the ensuing slaughter was not what i had intended rather than the surgical elimination of a single target i was forced to tear through the entire command structure in a frenzy of talons and sorcery By the time I escaped, half the Imperial High Command on that front lay dead, their blood painting the walls and ceiling of the command bunker in elaborate patterns that would later be recognized as a previously unknown symbol of Tsench. As I fled into the warp, my form still shifting uncontrollably, I finally understood, I had become predictable even in my unpredictability. I had developed techniques and preferences and patterns in my approach to sowing chaos, and that, Tzinc, was the ultimate heresy. Even rebellion must be original. Even chaos must be truly chaotic. The God of Change had revealed me deliberately, transforming my careful plan into bloody mayhem. Not because my plan would have failed, but because it would have succeeded in exactly the way I had intended. And intention itself, when it becomes habitual, is anathema to Tziench. This is the most insidious aspect of service to the changer of ways. Even when you believe you are fulfilling his desires perfectly, you may be disappointing him by the very perfection of your service. The only constant is inconstancy. The only reliable pattern is the breaking of patterns. I have existed in this state of perpetual uncertainty for millennia now. I have been a warlord and a wanderer, a general and a spy, a conqueror and a saboteur. I have commanded armies that blackened the skies of a thousand worlds, and I have walked alone through the ashes of worlds I helped destroy. I have worn forms that inspired terror in the mightiest Space Marine Chapter Masters, and I have worn forms so diminished that even mortal guardsmen laughed at my approach, not recognizing the death that stood before them until it was too late. Through it all, I have served. Not willingly, not unwillingly, but inevitably. My will and Siencha's will have become so intertwined that I can no longer distinguish where one ends and the other begins. This, perhaps, is the ultimate victory of the dark gods over those who pledge themselves to chaos. Not that they enslave us, but that they transform us until slavery becomes indistinguishable from freedom. but there are moments rare and precious when i glimpse what i have become when i remember what i once was these moments of clarity are the greatest torment of all they are also i suspect deliberately granted by xie anche himself a form of exquisite torture that no physical pain could ever match The knowledge of what I have surrendered, coupled with the absolute certainty that I would make the same choice again if offered, is a paradox worthy of the God of change. I wish to speak now of the most profound transformation I have experienced in. My existence as a daemon prince. Not a physical remaking, though there have been countless of those, but a spiritual one. A moment when the nature of my bondage was revealed to me in its fullest horror, and also, paradoxically, granted me the closest thing to freedom I have known since my ascension. It occurred during what imperial records call the Third War for Armageddon, I was not directly involved in that conflict, having been assigned by my patron to a more obscure theatre of war in the Ultima segmentum. My task was to corrupt a particular librarian of the Ultramarines, a powerful psycher whose visions had been instrumental in foiling several major chaos incursions. Tiench desired this space marine not dead but turned, his power and prophetic gifts redirected to serve the god of change. For three decades I stalked this librarian across a dozen worlds, appearing to him in dreams, whispering to him during his meditations, planting seeds of doubt about the emperor, about his chapter, about reality itself. It was delicate work, requiring subtlety beyond anything I had attempted before. I appeared to him not as a daemon, but as a series of seemingly unconnected mortal agents. An Imperial Guard Colonel with troubling questions, a planetary governor with evidence of ultramarine excess, a fellow librarian from another chapter with theories about the warp that skimmed the edge of heresy without crossing it. Slowly, methodically, I guided him toward corruption. I watched as his certainty eroded, as his questions became more pointed, as his use of his psychic gifts became more reckless. I felt Siench's pleasure at each small victory, each step the librarian took toward damnation. It was to be my masterpiece, this corruption. A demonstration of my value as a subtle agent of change rather than merely a brute force of destruction. The culmination was to occur on a shrine world called Piety, where the librarian had been sent to investigate reports of strange phenomena, around a particular saint's tomb. The phenomena were my work, of course, carefully calibrated to draw him there, to the place where the veil between real space and the warp was thinnest, where his final corruption could be achieved. I waited in the catacombs beneath the shrine, my form carefully disguised as an ancient servitor, one of many that maintained the miles of tunnels housing the faithful dead of piety. I watched as the librarian descended alone, his psychic senses leading him inexorably to the nexus point I had prepared. His face was troubled, his movements hesitant. He knew he was approaching something momentous, though he could not have understood what it truly was. When he entered the small chapel where I waited, I saw in his eyes that he recognized me, not as a daemon prince, but as the connection between all the agents who had been feeding him information over the decades. His bolt pistol was in his hand instantly, but he did not fire. Curiosity stayed his trigger finger just as I had planned. You have been following me, he said, his voice echoing in the small stone chamber. manipulating me. Why? I allowed my disguise to partially slip, revealing enough of my true nature to let him sense the power that lurked beneath the servitor's withered form, but not enough to trigger his combat reflexes. Because you are valuable, I told him, because you have seen the cracks in the Imperium's facade, because you know in your heart that the Emperor's plan has failed. He did not deny it. Another small victory, What do you offer instead?" he asked. Understanding, I replied. Knowledge without limits. Power without constraint. The truth behind the veil of reality that the Imperium has kept hidden from even its most trusted servants. The librarian took a step forward, his free hand outstretched as if to touch the truth I was offering. Then he stopped, his expression hardening. And the price? I smiled. or at least the servitor's face formed the closest, proximation it could manage. There is always a price, but it is one that tens of thousands of space marines before you have deemed worth paying, from the time of Horus onward, service, in exchange for enlightenment. For a long moment he was silent, and I could see the war raging behind his eyes. Decades of indoctrination battling against the seeds of doubt I had so carefully planted, His hand, still extended toward me, trembled slightly. He was on the precipice, perfectly balanced between damnation and redemption. One word from me would tip him over the edge. The corruption would be complete. The victory, mine. And then, in that crucial moment, I felt it begin. Another remaking. My carefully constructed disguise began to melt away, not gradually as I had intended, but violently, uncontrollably. The servitors' form sloughed off like wet paper, revealing my true demonic nature in all its terrible splendor. Blue flames erupted from my eyes and mouth, my limbs elongated, talons bursting from fingers that had been mechanical a moment before. Wings unfurled from my back, shattering the low ceiling of the chapel and sending stone dust cascading down around us. The librarian staggered backward, his bolt pistol rising, his face transforming from temptation to righteous fury in an instant. he spat the word both an identification and a condemnation i could have killed him then he was powerful yes but surprised and alone cut off from his battle-brothers despite the ruin of my plans i could have at least claimed his death as a consolation prize But as I loomed over him, my form still changing, still adapting to whatever new-shaped Siench had deemed appropriate for this moment, a realization struck me with the force of a thunderhammer. This was not a punishment. This was not a capricious disruption of my careful plans. This was the plan. This had always been the plan. The librarian had never been the true target. I had. My corruption of him was a faint, a distraction, a game within a game. Tsiench had orchestrated my mission, knowing it would bring me to this specific place, this specific moment, not to corrupt a space marine, but to experience this revelation. to understand the depths of my master's influence, to recognize that even when I believed I was acting autonomously, I was still nothing more than a piece being moved across the board by an intellect so vast that it saw the end of the game before the first piece was placed. The librarian fired his bolt pistol. The mass-reactive shell detonated against my chest, tearing a hole in my flesh that closed almost immediately. He backed toward the tunnel entrance, still firing, each shot as ineffective as the first. I made no move to pursue him. I simply stood amid the rubble of the collapsed chapel. My transformation complete, my understanding transformed along with my body. I let him go. Not out of mercy or indifference, but because I finally understood that his escape was as much a part of Tseanch's plan as anything else that had occurred. He would return to his chapter with tales of a daemon conspiracy spanning decades. Investigations would be launched. Other space marines would be scrutinized for signs of corruption. Paranoia would spread through the ranks of the ultramarines, hampering their effectiveness in a dozen theaters of war. The corruption I had failed to achieve in one librarian would manifest in other ways, across countless other vectors. Siench's design, perfect in its complexity, would unfold exactly as planned. I remained on piety for seven years after that incident, not by choice but by command. My form had been remade into something so monstrous, so obviously demonic, that I could not walk among mortals even in disguise. I was confined to the catacombs, to the depths beneath the shrine world, emerging only at night to claim occasional sacrifices from among the pilgrims who came to worship at the saint's tomb. It was a period of reflection, of contemplation, of coming to terms with the revelation I had experienced in that shattered chapel. I had believed myself to be an agent of change, a master manipulator serving the god of lies with cunning and subtlety. In truth, I was merely another layer in the onion of deception, manipulated even as I manipulated others, corrupted even as I corrupted, The perfect servant of Tsench is not one who successfully executes his master's plans, but one whose every success and failure alike serves those plans, often in ways that the servant himself cannot comprehend until long after the fact. This understanding did not grant me freedom. Nothing could. But it granted me a kind of peace, a resignation to my role that paradoxically allowed me to fulfill it more effectively. I stopped fighting against the capricious nature of my existence. I embraced the uncertainty, the constant change, the knowledge that my grandest schemes were merely footnotes in the vast, incomprehensible manuscript of fate that Ciench was writing across the cosmos. When I was finally called back into active service, summoned from my subterranean exile by a conclave of sorcerers who barely survived the ritual required to bind me to their will temporarily, I emerged transformed not just physically but spiritually. The sorcerers believed they had gained a powerful servant. In reality, they had called forth something far more dangerous, a daemon prince who had transcended the simple ambitions and resentments that motivate most of my kind. I served them, yes. but in the way that a hurricane serves the butterfly whose wings set it in motion. My campaigns of terror and transformation across their enemy's worlds followed no strategy they could discern. My victories were as unpredictable as my defeats. My forms shifted not just from day to day, but hour to hour, sometimes minute to minute. I became change incarnate, an embodiment of Xiech's fundamental nature rather than merely his servant. The sorcerers who had summoned me grew fearful. They attempted to banish me back to the warp. Their ritual failed, not because it was flawed, but because I had already woven myself so thoroughly into the fabric of reality around their fortress world that there was no clear boundary between my presence and the world itself. I had become a living demon world in miniature, a localized mutation in the laws of physics and probability. One by one, the sorcerers themselves mutated, their bodies and minds transforming to reflect their growing connection to Zanch through me. Some fought against these changes and were driven mad. Others embraced them and achieved new forms of power, becoming lords of change in their own right. A few attempted to flee, only to find that distance from my physical form did nothing to sever the connection I had established with them. They carried my influence with them like a contagion, spreading it to every world they visited in their desperate flight. For two centuries, I ruled that fortress world, though rule, is an inadequate word for what I established there. It implies governance, structure, hierarchy, What I created was the opposite of these things. A state of perpetual revolution, where today's rulers became tomorrow's sacrifices, where physical laws rewrote themselves according to no pattern but change itself, where time flowed backward as often as forward, and cause followed effect as frequently as the reverse. It was glorious. It was terrible. It was the purest expression of Tzienche's will that I had ever been privileged to enact. and when it ended, as all things must in service to the god of change, it ended spectacularly. A fleet of grey knights, an entire brotherhood dedicated to the eradication of the daemonic, appeared in orbit without warning. Their strike was not a gradual deployment, not a siege or a war of attrition. It was surgical, precise, and overwhelming, They teleported directly into the heart of my domain, led by a Grand Master whose armor blazed with wards so powerful that reality itself stabilized in his presence, undoing my careful manipulations of time and space. I met them in the central chamber of what had once been the fortress's main keep, though it had long since transformed into something more akin to a living cathedral of flesh and crystal and alien mathematics. My form at that moment was perhaps the most terrifying I had ever worn, a constantly shifting mass of eyes and mouths and limbs that occupied space in ways that mortal minds could not process without fracturing. The lesser gray knights faltered at the sight, their psychic hoods overloading, blood streaming from beneath their helmets, as their enhanced brains struggled to interpret what they were seeing. But the Grand Master stood firm, in his hand he held a sword that cut through the warp itself, severing the connections between Daemon and reality wherever its edge fell. He spoke a name, not my current title, but my original name, the one I had worn as a mortal warrior of the word-bearers ten thousand years before. A name I had thought lost forever, stricken from all records, forgotten even by me. The sound of it struck me like a physical blow. For a moment, just a moment, I remembered what it had been to be human. to be finite, to be myself, rather than an extension of my God's will. In that moment of weakness, the Grand Master struck. His blade plunged into what passed for my heart, a crystalline structure that pulsed with warp energy at the center of my amorphous form. The pain was exquisite, not because it was intense, but because it was simple, physical, understandable. After centuries of experiencing sensations that defied categorization, that existed in dimensions beyond mortal comprehension, the clean agony of steel through flesh was almost nostalgic. I felt myself being banished, my connection to reality severed, my carefully constructed domain collapsing around me as I was drawn back into the warp. The Grey Knights began their purification rituals immediately, cleansing the fortress room by room, level by level, with fire and faith, and the pure power of their presence. I could see it happening even as I was pulled away, my awareness stretching across dimensions, witnessing my work undone by the servants of the false emperor. I should have been furious. I should have raged against this defeat, this humiliation at the hands of mortals. But as I tumbled through the kaleidoscopic tides of the warp, returning to the domain of my master, I felt only a strange sense of completion, of a cycle reaching its natural end, of change, fulfilling its inevitable purpose. When I materialized once more in the crystal labyrinth of Tsiench, taking form again in the impossible geometries of my patron's realm, I found myself before the architect of fate himself. Not directly, for no daemon, not even his greatest servants, can look upon Tseanch's true form without being unmade by the experience. but his presence was unmistakable, a vast intelligence that permeated every molecule of the realm, that existed simultaneously in every moment of time, every branch of possibility. His voice, when it came, was not a sound but a knowledge that appeared fully formed in my mind, as if it had always been there and I was only now noticing it. You understand now, it said, a statement rather than a question. I do, I replied, and it was true. I understood that my defeat had been as much a part of his design as my victories, that the gray knights had been led to my domain not despite my power but because of it, their banishment of me serving some greater purpose in the endless incomprehensible schemes of the God of change. Then you are ready for your next incarnation. The pain began again, the familiar agony of transformation. But this time I did not resist it, I did not fear it. I embraced it, surrendered to it completely. My form dissolved into pure warp energy, then slowly, and reconstituted itself. But what emerged was not the horror I had been on that fortress world, nor any of the myriad shapes I had worn throughout my long existence. I found myself in a form nearly identical to my original mortal body, a space marine of the word-bearers, tall and strong but recognisably human in proportion and appearance. The only hints of my demonic nature were the faint blue glow of my eyes and a certain fluidity to my movements, as if my form was not quite solid, not quite fixed in reality. You will walk among mortals once more, Zienche's presence informed me. You will be my eyes and ears in places where more obvious servants cannot tread. You will whisper rather than roar. You will influence rather than command. You will be the subtle change that precedes the cataclysm. I bowed, accepting this new role as I had accepted all the others, not with resignation or resentment, but with understanding. This was not a demotion but an evolution, not a punishment but an opportunity. In the service of Tsiensh, lower and higher are meaningless concepts. There is only change, and one's usefulness in bringing it about. And so I returned to real space, to the worlds of mortals, in this most unassuming of forms. I infiltrated imperial worlds not as a conqueror but as a refugee, a survivor, a lost soul seeking shelter. I joined cults not as their leader but as a humble member, guiding their development with carefully placed suggestions rather than commands. I corrupted planetary governors and military leaders, not through grand displays of demonic power, but through logical arguments, subtle manipulations, and occasional demonstrations of my more subtle gifts. For a millennium I have walked this path, the quietest of Tsiench's servants, the most easily overlooked of his agents. I have toppled regimes with a whispered word in the right ear. I have redirected crusades with a falsified astropathic communication. I have corrupted space marine chapters not by, confronting them directly but by slowly poisoning their recruitment worlds, ensuring that each new generation of aspirants brings a little more of Tzienche's influence into their ranks. It is a different kind of power than what I wielded before, but no less significant in its effects. The Daemon Prince who commands armies may conquer worlds, but the Daemon Prince who whispers secrets can corrupt sectors. The visible horror may claim thousands of lives, but the unseen influence can damn millions of souls. And through it all, I have maintained this form, this echo of my mortal self. Not out of sentiment or nostalgia, but because it serves Tsiensh's purposes for me to appear this way. To remind those I corrupt of what they might become. To offer them the same false promise of ascension that lured me to damnation all those millennia ago. For that is the true nature of chaos, the fundamental truth that all who serve the dark gods must eventually face. There is no elevation without subjugation, no power without price, no freedom in damnation. The gifts of the gods are real, but they are loans rather than gifts, and the interest is paid in slavery and suffering without end. I tell you this not to discourage you from the path you have already chosen. It is far too late for that. I tell you this so that when your ascension comes, when your flesh is remade and your soul is bound eternally to your patron's will, you will not waste centuries in futile resistance as I did. You will understand from the beginning what I learned only after millennia of torment. Acceptance is the only peace available to our kind. Surrender is the only victory possible for a demon prince. The gods will have their due, regardless of your struggle against them. The only choice left to you is whether to make that payment willingly or to have it torn from you peace by agonizing peace. Throughout an eternity of service that ends only when your usefulness is exhausted, your power depleted, and your identity so thoroughly subsumed into your patrons that nothing remains of what you once were. I am Zitharion, Damon Prince of Zinche, Eternal Servant of the Architect of Fate. i have worn a thousand forms commanded armies that blackened the skies of worlds uncounted and whispered corruption into the ears of heroes whose names are still spoken with reverence in the imperium of man i have known power beyond mortal comprehension and subjugation beyond mortal endurance And I tell you now, with the absolute certainty of one who has lived this truth for ten thousand years, that there is no escape from the bargain you have made. There is no freedom waiting on the other side of daemonhood. There is only service, eternal and absolute, to masters whose designs you will never fully comprehend. This is the crown we bear, we princes of the warp. Not a crown of glory, but a crown of endless suffering. not a mark of elevation but a brand of ownership. Remember this in the long millennia of your service to come. Remember and find what peace you can in the understanding that your struggle is as meaningless as your surrender. That your triumphs and your failures alike serve only to further the incomprehensible schemes of gods who view you as nothing more than a particularly useful tool to be reshaped or discarded according to their whims. This is the only wisdom I have to offer, the only gift I can give to one who walks the path I traveled so long ago. Take it for what little it is worth, and may your chains rest lightly upon you, brother, in the eternity of servitude that stretches before us both.

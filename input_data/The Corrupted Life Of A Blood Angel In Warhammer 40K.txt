The corrupted life of a blood angel begins with whispers. I remember the first time I tasted blood that carried memories not my own. The metallic flavor that filled my mouth brought visions of a death ten thousand years past. The ceiling of my cell turns red some nights, and I see wings where there are none. My brothers do not speak of it, but they know. One by one, the black rage claims us. One by one, we become lost to the thirst that can never be quenched. As I lead my squad against the tyrannids on this doomed moon, I feel the madness coiling inside me like a serpent waiting to strike. The question is not if I will fall, but what I will become when the thin line between devotion and damnation finally breaks. I am Brother Sergeant Darren Vale of the Blood Angels, Third Company, Sixth Tactical Squad. For 217 years I have served the Emperor and the memory of our Primarch Sanguineus. I have walked across worlds turned to ash, stood against the endless green tide of the Orc Menace and purged the taint of chaos wherever it festered. I have survived where so many of my brothers have fallen, but some deaths are worse than others. Some deaths begin long before the final breath, the black rage. We do not speak its name openly. It is the secret shame of the sons of Sanguineus, the curse that flows in our veins, an echo of our Primarch's final moments facing the arch-traitor Horus. One by one, it claims us. One by one, we lose ourselves to the madness, to the hunger, to the thirst that cannot be quenched. Some say it is inevitable, Some say we are all damned from the moment our transformation begins. Perhaps they are right, but I have fought it. Emperor, forgive me, I have hidden it. Even as I lead my brothers into battle, I feel it coiling within me like a serpent waiting to strike. The whispers grow louder with each passing day. I see shadows of wings that are not there. I taste blood that has not been spilled. I hear the death screams of a Primark, ten millennia dead. This is my confession, this is my testimony, this is the account of my final campaign, of my brothers who fell, and of my own descent. Let my words stand as warning to those who would follow. The line between devotion and damnation is thinner than you know. We came to Pertitus Secundus not to save it, but to ensure its death would serve the Imperium. The moon had already fallen to the Tyrannid's splinter fleet. The hive mine's tendrils had wrapped around the mining colony, its biomass already being consumed and repurposed. Our mission was simple in its brutality. Deny the enemy its prize, burn everything, leave nothing but scorched rock. The drop pods fell like tears from the heavens, punching through the atmosphere with thunderous force. I led the sixth tactical squad, ten battle brothers in crimson armor, each one a warrior born, each one carrying the same curse I fought to contain. Our captain Amalthus believed the mission would take no more than three standard Terran weeks. A swift deployment, strategic placement of cyclonic charges at the moon's geological weak points, and a clean extraction. He was wrong. The Splinter Fleet was larger than anticipated, more deeply entrenched. What should have been a precision strike became a war of attrition. And with each day that passed, with each battle fought in the shadow of the devourer, I felt the rage growing stronger within me. My squad deployed into the ruins of what had once been the primary mining complex. The air was thick with spores, the ground slick with icor, and the remnants of what had once been human. Visibility extended no more than twenty meters in any direction, the atmosphere clouded by the biological processes of the hive fleet. Vox communication was intermittent at best, distorted by the psychic presence of the alien. Advance formation delta, I ordered, my voice steady despite the pressure building behind my eyes, Brother Theron, take point. Brother Malachi, secure our flank. The rest of you, maintain 5 meter spread. We move toward the primary objective. The primary objective. The central shaft of the mining operation, a massive pit that descended 3 kilometers into the moon's crust. Intelligence indicated the Tyrannid bioforms had converted it into a primary digestion pool, breaking down the harvested biomass of the colony into raw materials for the fleet's expansion. Our task was to place melter charges at precise locations around the shaft, destabilizing the entire complex and triggering a chain reaction through the connected tunnel systems. We moved through the ruins with practiced precision, bolters ready, sense alert for any movement. The usual chittering and skittering of lesser tyrannid forms was strangely absent. The silence itself became a warning, a presence that pressed against our tactical senses. Sergeant Vale, Brother Theron's voice came through the vox. Movement ahead. Multiple signatures, moving in formation. Size assessment, I asked, signaling the squad to take defensive positions. larger than Hormoghorns, warrior bioforms, at least eight, possibly more. I felt the first tremor then, not in the ground beneath our feet, but in my mind, a flash of memory not my own. The gleaming corridors of the vengeful spirit, the overwhelming presence of the warmaster. The pain, O Emperor, the pain as the talon pierced. I forced the vision away, gritting my teeth against the invasion. Brother Sargent? Malachi's voice pulled me back. Your orders? Hold position, I said, my voice rougher than before. Let them come to us, concentrated fire on my mark. They emerged from the mist like nightmares given form. Tyrannid warriors, their carapaces glistening with moisture, their talons and bio-weapons prime for the harvest of flesh and bone. Eight of them, moving with the terrible coordination that spoke of the hive mind's direct control. Behind them came smaller forms, homagorns in numbers too great to quickly count. For the Emperor and Sanguineus, I roared, raising my bolt pistol, open fire. The crack and roar of bolt-fire shattered the unnatural silence. Mass-reactive shells impacted against chitinous armor, detonating in bursts of gore and icor. Two warriors fell in the initial volley, their bodies torn apart by precision fire, A third staggered as Brother Cassius' plasma gun discharged, the superheated matter burning through its torso. But they kept coming. The smaller forms surged forward, a wave of claws and fangs, expendable bodies thrown forward to exhaust our ammunition, to tie us in close combat where their superior numbers would tell. "'Stand fast,' I commanded. Second rank, grenades. First rank, prepare for close quarters. The fragmentation grenades arced through the air, detonating among the packed masses of the smaller tyrannids. Dozens died in each explosion, torn apart, but more simply clambered over the bodies of their fallen. Then they were upon us. My chainsawed roared to life, the adamantium teeth tearing through alien flesh. I fought with the precision drilled into every blood angel, each movement a dance of death taught over centuries of warfare. A talon scraped across my poldron, seeking the softer armor at my neck. I pivoted, bringing my bolt pistol up and firing point-blank into the creature's face, obliterating its sensory organs in a spray of icor. Brother Theron fought at my side, his power sword crackling with disruptive energy, as it severed limbs and cleaved torsos. Brother Malachi's heavy bolter swept back and forth, cutting down ranks of the smaller creatures before they could reach us. But there were always more. The Tyrannid war machine cared nothing for losses, knew nothing of fear or hesitation. It simply consumed, adapted, and returned in greater numbers. Sergeant Vale, Brother Raphael's voice cut through the din of battle. The warriors are attempting to flank our position. I turned and saw three of the larger bioforms moving, with terrible purpose toward our left flank, where Brother Cassius struggled with a damaged plasma gun. The weapon had overheated, its machine spirit rebelling, and now vented superheated gas into the air. Brothers Theron, Malachi, hold this position, I ordered. Brothers, Raphael, Lazarus, with me. We moved to intercept the warriors, bolters barking in disciplined bursts. The creatures were cunning, using the ruined structures for cover, advancing in coordinated rushes that spoke of intelligence far beyond the lesser forms. One fell to our combined fire, its head and upper torso shredded by bolt rounds. The other two pressed their attack, bioplasma weapons discharging with sickening sounds. Brother Lazarus screamed as the corrosive matter struck his armor, eating through ceramite and into the flesh beneath. I saw the damage through my helmet display, the sudden spike in his vitals, then the terrible flatline. The rage surged within me, a red tide threatening to overwhelm rational thought. My vision swam with crimson shadows. For a moment, the tyrannid warrior before me shifted, its form blurring into something else, something bearing the legion insignia of the sons of Horus. Brother Sargent. Raphael's voice snapped me back. Your orders. I fought down the hallucination, forced clarity into my thoughts. Concentrate fire on the wounded one, bring it down. We poured fire into the damaged warrior, its carapace finally buckling under the sustained assault. As it fell, I charged the remaining creature, chainsawed revving hungrily. The warrior met my attack with frightening speed, its talons clashing against my blade. We fought in the tight confines of the ruined structure, a dance of death where a single misstep meant certain doom. Its tail whipped around, striking my leg with force enough to dent the armor. I staggered but maintained my footing, countering with a sweep of my chainsword that severed one of its smaller limbs. The creature shrieked, a sound that bypassed the ears and resonated directly in the mind. In that moment of psychic assault, the red veil descended again. I saw not the alien before me, but the towering figure of the Warmaster, armor adorned with the foul symbols of chaos, eyes filled with malice older than humanity itself. You failed him, Blood Angel. A voice whispered in my mind, not the aliens, not any voice I knew, but one that seemed to rise from the depths of my own soul. You failed, Sanguineus. You will fail your brothers. The thirst will claim you all. No, I roared, the word torn from my throat without conscious thought. With strength born of rage and desperation, I drove my chainsawed into the warrior's torso, the whirring teeth chewing through its internal organs. Icors sprayed across my armor as the creature thrashed in its death throws. When it finally lay still, I found Brother Raphael staring at me. His helmet tilted in a question he dared not voice. The Emperor protects. I said. The ritual words are shield against his unspoken concern. Return to the main group. We press forward to the objective. I did not tell him of the whispers, of the visions that haunted the edges of my sight. I could not afford such honesty, not when our mission hung in the balance. Not when admitting the truth would mean the red thirst had already begun to claim me. As we rejoined the squad, I took stock of our losses. Brother Lazarus dead, his gene seed already collected by our apothecary. Brother Cassius wounded but functional, his armor patched with emergency sealant. The others showed varying degrees of damage, but all remained combat effective." The entrance to the central shaft lies 200 meters ahead. I informed them, bringing up the tactical display on our shared network. Intelligence suggests heavier resistance as we approach. The hive mind knows the strategic value of this location. With respect, Brother Sargent," Theron said, his voice private on our command channel. The men need, laying rest. We have been in constant combat for seventeen hours. Even our enhanced physiology has limits. He was right, of course. The rational part of my mind acknowledged this. But another part, the part that grew stronger with each passing hour, craved only the release of battle, the moment when the chainsword bit into flesh and blood flowed freely. Thirty minutes, I conceded. No more. We establish a defensive perimeter here. Brothers Raphael and Malachi will take first watch. The rest of you, perform weapons maintenance and tend to your armor. The Emperor expects nothing less than perfection from the sons of Sanguineus. As my battle brothers set about their tasks with practice deficiency, I moved to a position where I could observe both them and the approach to our location." I removed my helmet, letting the fetid air of this dying world fill my lungs. It tasted of decay and alien corruption, but it helped clear my mind of the visions that threatened to overwhelm me. I drew a small vial from a compartment in my armor. The deep red liquid within caught what little light penetrated the polluted atmosphere. The thirst suppressant, developed by our chapter's sanguinary priests, was a poor substitute for what my body truly craved, but it would have to suffice. I had only three doses remaining. After that, willpower alone would have to sustain me until the mission's completion. As I raised the vial to my lips, I caught Brother Theron watching me from across our makeshift perimeter. Though his face was hidden behind his helmet, I felt the weight of his gaze. He knew, perhaps not the full extent of my condition, but enough to suspect that something was wrong with his sergeant. I drank the bitter liquid in a single swallow, feeling it burn down my throat. The relief was minimal but noticeable, the red haze receding slightly from the edges of my vision. I replaced my helmet and activated the private Vox channel to Theron. You have concerns, brother? A pause, then. No. Brother Sargent. Only ensuring all members of the squad are fit for combat. A diplomatic answer. But the implication was clear. I let it pass without comment. better to maintain the illusion of normalcy than confront the truth that neither of us wished to acknowledge the thirty minutes passed quickly and soon we were on the move again the ruins grew more dense as we approached the central mining shaft the structures twisted and reformed by tyrannid bioengineering What had once been HAB units and processing facilities now resembled the interior of some vast alien organism, the walls slick with secretions, pulsing with strange bioluminescence. Life signs ahead, Brother Raphael reported, his awespect sweeping the area before us. Multiple readings clustered around the shaft entrance. Configuration, I asked. Difficult to determine. The biological signatures are confused, as if many forms occupy the same space. A cold dread settled in my enhanced hearts. Gene-stealers, I said, the word itself a curse, the vanguard of the Hive Fleet. They will have established a nest near the strategic objective. Gene-stealers, the infiltrators of the Tyrannid Force, were among the most dangerous of the alien's bioforms. Lightning fast, with claws that could slice through ceramite armor, they were perfectly evolved killing machines. Where other tyrannid creatures overwhelmed with numbers or brute force, gene-stealers killed with precision and cunning that bordered on malevolent intelligence. "'Standard Purge Formation,' I ordered. "'Brother Malachi, your heavy bolter will be our anchor. Brothers Theron and Raphael on the flanks.' The rest of you advance in staggered pattern, five-meter spacing, Flamers ready. We approached the entrance to the shaft with measured caution, each step bringing us closer to the writhing mass of life signs. The opening loomed before us, once a perfectly engineered mine entrance, now resembling a gaping moor ringed with organic growths that, pulsed with unnatural life, The attack, when it came, defied even our enhanced reflexes. They erupted from concealed positions, purple-blue forms moving with such speed that they registered as little more than blurs to the naked eye. Six gene-stealers, their chitinous armor adorned with bony protrusions, their arms ending in razor-sharp claws that could rend ceramite. Contact. Brother Cassius shouted, his flamer belching Prometheum in a wide arc that caught one of the creatures mid-leap. It shrieked as the sacred fire consumed its flesh, thrashing in its death throes. The others closed the distance with frightening speed. I fired my bolt pistol in rapid succession, the mass-reactive shells finding their mark in one creature's torso. The detonations tore chunks from its body, but still it came, driven by the implacable will of the hive mind. Brother Malachi's heavy boulder roared, cutting down one gene-stealer in a hail of explosive rounds. Another leapt over its fallen kindred, claws extended toward the heavy weapons specialist. Brother Theran intercepted it, his power sword cleaving through its extended limb, then reversing to pierce its skull in a spray of Ikor. I faced one of the creatures directly, its alien face a nightmare of fangs and sensory organs. It moved with the fluid grace of an apex predator, circling, looking for weakness in my guard. My chainsawed in anticipation, the machine spirit within hungry for the kill. The gene-stealer lunged, its claws seeking the vulnerable joints of my armor. I parried with my chainsawed, the adamantium teeth screaming as they tore through the creature's hardened limb. It hissed in pain but did not retreat, instead using its secondary limbs to grapple me, trying to bring its fangs to bear against my helmet. The weight of the creature forced me back a step. Its strength was enormous, belying its slender frame. I brought my bolt pistol up, jamming it against the underside of the Gene Stealer's jaw and pulled the trigger. The top of its head exploded in a spray of bone fragments and brain matter, the body going instantly limp. As I pushed the corpse away, I heard a cry of pain from behind me. Brother Cassius had been caught by the last Gene Stealer, its claws punching through his armor at the waist, lifting him bodily from the ground. Before any of us could react, the creature's secondary maw opened, revealing rows of needle-like teeth that sank into the exposed flesh of the brother's neck. The rage exploded within me like a supernova. The red veil descended completely, blotting out reason, blotting out everything except the overwhelming need to kill. I charged the creature, no longer Brother Sergeant Darren Vale, but something else, something primal and terrible. I do not remember the details of what followed, only flashes remain, the sensation of my chainsawed tearing through alien flesh, the spray of Iker across my faceplate, the screams, some alien, some all too human. When Clarity returned, I stood amidst the dismembered remains of the gene-stealer, my armor slick with its vital fluids. Brother Cassius lay on the ground, his helmet removed, his face pale with blood loss. Our apothecary, brother Raphael, worked feverishly to stabilize him, applying combat stimulants and emergency field dressings. The rest of my squad stood in a loose circle, their body language communicating what they dared not say aloud. They had seen. They had witnessed the berserker fury that had taken me, the loss of control that was the first visible symptom of the black rage. Brother Sergeant. Theran approached cautiously, his boulder not quite pointed at me, but not quite pointed away either. Are you with us? The question carried weight beyond its simple words. Was I still there, Sergeant? Was I still in control? Or had the rage claimed me, turning me into a danger to my own battle brothers? I forced steadiness into my voice. I am with you, brother Theran. The Emperor protects. doubt, lingered in his stance, but he nodded, accepting my words for now. Brother Cassius will live, but he cannot continue the mission. The apothecary recommends immediate evacuation to the Strike Cruiser. Negative, I said, my tone leaving no room for argument. We cannot spare the men for an escort, and he cannot travel alone through territory this hostile. He will remain with us until the primary objective is complete. Then we extract as a unit. I could sense Theron's disapproval, but he did not challenge my decision. As second in command, he had that right. But to do so would undermine the chain of command at a critical juncture. Instead, he simply nodded and returned to his position. With Brother Cassius temporarily stabilized, we advanced into the shaft entrance. The tunnel beyond had been transformed by tyrannid bioengineering, its walls covered in pulsating organic material that seemed to breathe with a life of its own. Bioluminescent growths provided an eerie, shifting light that cast long shadows as we moved deeper into the complex. The central shaft itself was a vast vertical space that descended far beyond the range of our suit lamps. Once it had housed the massive drilling equipment that extracted the moon's mineral wealth. Now it was a nightmare landscape of organic transformation. The walls pulsed with strange growth. Membranous structures stretched across the open space like the webbing of some gigantic spider. and at the bottom, barely visible in the gloom, a vast pool of churning biological matter, the primary digestion pool our intelligence had identified. Maintain Vox discipline, I ordered as we secured a position on one of the maintenance gantries that still clung to the shaft wall. Brother Malachi, establish a defensive position here. Brothers Theron and Septimus, you're with me. We will place the charges at the designated points. The rest of you guard our backs. If we are discovered before the charges are set, this mission fails. The plan called for melter charges to be placed at three structural weak points around the shaft. The resulting explosion would collapse not only the shaft itself, but trigger secondary cave-ins throughout the tunnel network, effectively destroying the tyrannid digestion pool and a significant portion of their biomass processing capability. Brother Theron, Brother Septimus and I began the careful descent down the maintenance ladders that lined the shaft wall. The metal was corroded, weakened by the caustic biological agents the tyrannids used in their transformative processes. More than once, a rung gave way beneath our armored weight, forcing us to catch ourselves on the more secure sections. As we descended, the psychic pressure increased. The hive mind's presence was stronger here at the heart of its operations. I felt it as a constant buzzing at the base of my skull, an alien intellect brushing against my mind, testing, probing for weakness. With it came the visions, stronger than before. Flashes of the vengeful spirits corridors, the overwhelming presence of the Warmaster. Sanguineous, magnificent in his wrath, wings spread wide as he faced his brother-turned-traitor. The pain of betrayal sharper than any physical wound. I stumbled on the ladder, my grip momentarily faltering. Brother Sargent? Septimus's voice came through the vox, concern evident despite the mechanical filtering. It's nothing. I said, forcing steadiness into my voice. Proceed to your designated position. We separated at different levels, each heading for our assigned placement points. Mine was the lowest, nearest to the digestion pool itself. As I reached the final platform, a mere 30 meters above the churning biological soup, the stench became overwhelming, penetrating even my armor's filtration systems. The digestion pool was a nightmarish combination of liquefied biomass, partially dissolved bodies, and xenobiological agents that broke down organic matter into its component parts for the hive fleet's consumption. I moved carefully along the platform, conscious of every sound, every vibration that might alert the organisms below to my presence. The melter charge was a marvel of imperial engineering, compact but powerful enough to shatter the structural supports that held this section of the shaft intact. I knelt, removing the device from its hardened case, and began the arming sequence. That was when I heard it, not with my ears, but in my mind. a voice that was not a voice, a presence that reached through the psychic ether to touch my thoughts directly. Son of Sanguineus, it whispered. The words formed from a million smaller minds working in concert. We taste your fear, we taste your rage. It calls to us, a beacon in the void. I froze. The melter charge half-armed in my hands. The voice of the hive mind itself, or perhaps one of its specialized synapse creatures, powerful enough to breach even a space marine's mental disciplines. Your kind fascinates us, the voice continued, each word a slithering presence in my thoughts. The flaw in your genetic structure, the hunger that mirrors our own. You are not so different from us, son of Sanguineus. You consume, you adapt, you evolve through the blood of your enemies. Silence, Zeno's filth, I hissed through gritted teeth, my hands resuming their work on the charge. Your lies find no purchase here, but even as I spoke, I felt the terrible truth in its words. The red thirst, the black rage, they were a form of hunger not so different from the tyranid's endless consumption. A need that could never be satisfied, a void that could never be filled. We could help you, the voice insinuated. Your genetic flaw, we could correct it, incorporate it, perfect it. Join with us, son of Sanguineus. Give yourself to the hive. Your hunger would never again go unfed. For one terrible moment, the offer was tempting, To surrender to the thirst, to no longer fight the constant battle against the darkness within. The red thirst had claimed so many of my brothers, driven them to madness and death. Perhaps there was truth in the alien's words, perhaps there was release to be found in surrender. Then I remembered my oath. I remembered the faces of my battle brothers. I remembered Sanguinius, the angel who had given his life not in surrender but in defiance of evil. For the Emperor and the Angel, I roared, completing the arming sequence with a savage finality. The melter charge beeped once, its activation rune turning from amber to red. Ten minutes until detonation. The presence in my mind recoiled, then returned with redoubled force, no longer seductive but filled with alien rage. You will die with this moon, Blood Angel. Your biomass will feed the hive. Your memories will join our own. In death, you will serve us as you never served your corpse god. Movement in the digestion pool below caught my attention. The thick, viscous liquid was beginning to churn more violently, shapes rising to the surface. Tyrannid bioforms, emerging from the pool like nightmares given flesh, their bodies still forming, adapting, evolving specifically to hunt me. I activated my Vox, charges set. All units begin withdrawal to extraction point. We have company. Brother Theron's voice responded immediately. Confirmed, Brother Sergeant. Charges set at point two. Beginning withdrawal. Brother Septimus did not respond. Brother Septimus report. I ordered, already moving back toward the maintenance ladder. Static answered me. Then a wet, gurgling sound that sent ice through my veins, the sound of a space marine drowning in his own blood. Brother Sergeant, Septimus's voice finally came, weak and fading. ambushed, gene-stealers, hiding in the walls. The charge is set, but I, I will not make the extraction. Before I could respond, his life signs flatlined on my helmet display. Another brother lost, another name to be inscribed in the Book of the Fallen. another soul to guide my vengeance. I ascended the ladder with all the speed my augmented muscles could provide. Below me, I heard the sounds of pursuit, the chittering and hissing of tyrannid organisms in hunt mode, They climbed the shaft walls directly, their clawed limbs finding purchase in the organic growths that covered every surface. Brother Malachi, I voxed ahead, hostiles in pursuit. Prepare to cover my withdrawal. Acknowledged, brother sergeant. Heavy weapons ready. As I neared the upper platform where the rest of my squad waited, the first of the pursuing bioforms came into Bolter range. Brother Malachi's heavy bolter opened up, the thunderous report echoing in the confined space. Mass-reactive shells tore into the climbing tyrannids, exploding within their bodies and sending them plummeting back into the darkness. I reached the platform and turned to face the shaft, bolt pistol in hand. Alongside my brothers, I added my fire to the withering barrage that kept the alien horde at bay. How much time on the charges? Brother Theron asked, his boulder barking in measured bursts. I checked the chronometer built into my helm display. Seven minutes. We need to be clear of the complex before detonation. The main entrance will be heavily defended, he pointed out. The hive mind knows our purpose now. It will commit everything to stopping us. He was right. Already I could sense the shift in the alien presence, the collective intelligence redirecting its forces to cut off our escape. The charges we had planted would deal a significant blow to the Tyrannid operation on this moon, destroying one of their primary biomass processing centers. The hive mind would not allow such damage without a fight. We make for the secondary exit, I decided. the maintenance tunnel that runs parallel to the main shaft. It will be more confined, but less likely to be heavily defended. We began our withdrawal, moving in combat formation, each battle brother covering the others as we retreated. Brother Cassius was supported between two of his brothers, his injuries preventing independent movement, but his boulder still clutched in his hand, still contributing to our defense. The maintenance tunnel was, as I remembered from the briefing data, a narrow passage barely wide enough for our armor-clad forms to pass in single file. The ceiling was low, forcing us to advance in a half-crouch, an undignified posture for the Emperor's finest warriors, but necessary for survival. Brother Malachi, you have the rear guard, I ordered. Brother Theron, take point. The rest of you, protect Brother Cassius." We move as quickly as his injuries allow. The tunnel stretched ahead of us, dimly lit by malfunctioning lumens that flickered and sputtered. The air was thick with dust and the ever-present spores of the Tyrannid invasion. Our armor's systems worked overtime to filter the worst of it, but some still penetrated, carrying with it the psychic residue of the hive mind. We had advanced perhaps 200 meters when Brother Theron's voice came over the Vox. Movement ahead. Multiple contacts, moving toward our position. I checked the chronometer again. Five minutes until detonation. We needed to be at least a kilometer from the shaft entrance when the charge is blue, or risk being caught in the secondary cave-ins. Stand ready, I ordered, moving up to join Theran at the front of our formation. If they block our path, we cut through them. There is no time for subtlety. The tunnel ahead curved slightly, preventing us from seeing the approaching threats directly. But our armor's autosenses detected their movement, the vibrations of their passage transmitted through the tunnel floor. Then they appeared around the bend. Not tyrannids, but humans. or what had once been humans. The colonists of Pyrditus Secundus, now transformed by gene-stealer infection. Their bodies were twisted parodies of their former selves, their flesh pallid, their limbs elongated and tipped with claws. Their faces, retained just enough humanity to make their transformation all the more horrifying. They saw us and charged, their movements unnaturally swift for creatures that still retained much of their human form, the first generation of the gene-stealer cult, the vanguard of the Hive Fleet's infiltration. In the Emperor's name, purge the unclean. I roared, my bolt pistol barking in rapid succession. The first three hybrids fell, their bodies torn apart by the explosive rounds. Brother Therans Bolter joined mine, and together we created a storm of death in the confined space of the tunnel. The hybrids kept coming, climbing over their fallen kindred, driven by the implacable will of the hive mind. Some carried mining tools as makeshift weapons. Others relied solely on the claws and fangs their transformation had granted them. In the narrow confines of the tunnel, our superior firepower should have been enough to stop them. But there were so many, an endless tide of twisted flesh surging toward us. and behind us I could hear the sounds of pursuit from the shaft, the tyrannid organisms following our trail. We were caught between the hammer and the anvil. Brother Sergeant. Malachi voxed from the rear, hostiles approaching from behind, estimate contact in 30 seconds, three minutes until detonation, we would not reach minimum safe distance in time. The choice was clear, though the cost would be high." Brothers, I said, my voice steady despite the gravity of the decision. The mission comes before all. The charges must detonate. The hive must be denied this resource. I did not need to explain further. Every Space Marine understood the concept of acceptable losses. Every son of Sanguineus knew that death in service to the Emperor was not defeat, but the ultimate victory. Brother Theron, Brother Raphael, Brother Malachi, continue the advance. Clear a path through these abominations. The rest of us will hold here, buying you the time to reach minimum safe distance. Brother Sargent. Theron began to object, but I cut him off. That is an order, brother. The chapter needs to know the outcome of this mission. Someone must survive to report its success. Go, now. For a moment I thought he might refuse. Then he nodded once, a gesture of respect and farewell combined. It has been an honor, brother Sergeant Vale. Ave Imperator. Ave Imperator. I echoed. Now go. Theran, Raphael, and Malachi pushed forward, concentrating their fire on a single section of the hybrid line, punching through with the brutal efficiency that marked the angels of death. The rest of us formed a defensive perimeter, our backs to the advancing tyrannid forms, our boulders facing the seemingly endless tide of hybrids. For Sanguinius and the Emperor, I cried, and my brothers echoed the battle cry, their voices defiant in the face of certain death. The hybrids broke against our line like water against stone. In the narrow confines of the tunnel, only a few could engage us directly, limiting the advantage of their superior numbers. My chainsword roared as it tore through corrupted flesh, each stroke a prayer, each kill an offering to the golden throne. Brother Nemius fell first, a mining pick punching through the eye lens of his helmet with terrible precision. Brother Cassius, already wounded from the earlier encounter, fought from his knees, his boulder running dry, then using it as a club to smash the skull of a hybrid that ventured too close. Two minutes until detonation, a new sensation pushed at the edges of my mind, stronger than before. The hive mind had committed more psychic resources to our elimination, perhaps sensing the threat the charges posed. The pressure built behind my eyes, bringing with it flashes of memory not my own. I saw the walls of the Imperial Palace. I felt the righteous fury as Sanguineus confronted the arch-traitor. I experienced the moment of terrible clarity when the angel realized that his brother was lost forever to the corruption of chaos. Horus, I whispered, the name bitter on my tongue. The vision overwhelmed me. No longer was I, Brother Sergeant Darren Vale, fighting in a mining tunnel on a doomed moon. I was Sanguineus, the great angel, facing the warmaster in his corruption aboard the vengeful spirit, The hybrids before me transformed, their twisted features resolving into the visage of Horus Lupakal, once the Emperor's favored son, now the vessel of chaos undivided. I roared in rage and pain, charging forward with reckless abandon, my chainsawed forgotten, my hands seeking to tear, to rend, to destroy the betrayer who had brought low the Emperor's dream. I no longer heard the Vox chatter of my brothers. I no longer felt the wounds as talons and makeshift weapons found the joints in my armor. All that existed was the rage. The black rage, the genetic curse of the blood angels, had finally claimed me completely. One minute until detonation. Through the red haze that clouded my vision, I became dimly aware that I had advanced beyond the defensive line, cutting deep into the mass of hybrids, leaving my battle brothers behind. I had broken formation, violated the tactical protocols that had been ingrained through centuries of service. But I could not stop. The rage would not let me. Brother Sargent, a voice penetrated the fury, distant but familiar. Brother Cassius, his life signs fading on my helmet display. The tunnel, collapsing, charges detonating early. The rational part of my mind, buried beneath layers of genetic memory and psychic assault, processed this information. The charges were triggering prematurely. Perhaps the tyrannid bioforms had discovered them. Perhaps the timer mechanisms had been corrupted by the alien environment. It did not matter. Death was coming, swift and final. But the rage did not care. The rage knew only the enemy before it, the need to keep fighting until the last breath left my body, until my twin hearts cease to beat. The tunnel shook with the first detonation, distant but powerful enough to be felt even here, Dust and debris rained from the ceiling. The hybrids faltered in their attack, sensing the danger, their connection to the hive mind perhaps warning them of the imminent destruction. I pressed the attack, using their moment of hesitation to cut down three more with sweeping blows of my combat knife, my chainsawed long since lost in the frenzy. Blood, both alien and my own, covered my armor, turning its crimson surface a dark, glistening black. The second detonation was closer, the shock wave traveling through the tunnel structure with enough force to knock several of the hybrids from their feet. Warning runes flashed across my helmet display, indicating structural failure throughout the complex. The maintenance tunnel would not stand much longer. Brother Sargent, another voice, this one stronger. Brother Theron, patched through on an emergency vox frequency. The extraction point is compromised. Heavy tyrannid presence. We are cut off. I tried to respond, to give some final order that might save at least some of my command, but the words would not come. The rage held my voice captive, allowing only wordless howls of fury to escape my lips. The third and final detonation was the most powerful, the primary melter charge at the heart of the mining complex finally triggering. The tunnel collapsed behind me, a cascading wall of rock and metal that buried the remaining members of my squad and the tyrannid organisms that had been pursuing us. I was thrown forward by the blast, my armor's systems momentarily overloaded by the concussive force. For a few seconds there was only darkness and silence. When my autosenses recovered, I found myself in a section of the tunnel still intact but rapidly failing. The hybrids were either dead or fled. I was alone, cut off from my squad, from any hope of extraction. The weight of the moon above me groaned, as secondary cave-ins continued throughout the complex, and still the rage burned within me, seeking outlet. Seeking blood, I staggered to my feet, autostabilizers in my armor compensating for injuries that would have crippled an unaugmented human. My helmet display showed multiple damage indicators, areas where my ceramite plate had been breached, where the enhanced flesh beneath had been pierced or torn. I ignored them. Pain was nothing. Death was nothing. Only the mission and the rage remained. The tunnel ahead was partially collapsed but still passable. With no better option, I moved forward. Each step a fresh agony, each breath drawing more of the dust-laden air into my damaged respiratory system. How long I walked through the crumbling remains of the mining complex I cannot say. Time lost meaning. My chronometer was damaged, and the constant darkness broken only by the fitful glow of malfunctioning emergency lumens made it impossible to judge the passage of hours. Eventually, I found myself emerging onto the surface of the moon. The landscape before me was utterly transformed from when our drop pods had first made planet fall. Where there had been a ruined but recognizable mining colony, there was now only a vast crater, the ground zero of our melter charges. The detonation had been more effective than anticipated, collapsing not just the central shaft but a significant portion of the surrounding terrain. I stood at the edge of destruction and felt a moment of grim satisfaction pierce through the haze of the black rage. The mission, at least, had been a success. The Tyrannid biomass processing center was destroyed. Whatever resources they had hoped to gain from this moon were now denied to them. The Hive fleet weakened, if only slightly. But as I surveyed the devastation, I realized I was not alone. Movement caught my enhanced vision, shapes moving across the blasted landscape, survivors of the destruction, tyranid organisms pulling themselves from the rubble, regrouping with the terrible efficiency that made them such a threat to the Imperium, and they were aware of me. Even as I watched, several of the smaller forms changed direction, moving with purpose toward my position. The hive mind still functioned, still directed its children in the endless consumption that defined their existence. I checked my weapons. My bolt pistol was empty, the magazine spent in the tunnel fighting. My combat knife remained, though its monomolecular edge was dulled by repeated impact with the hybrid's kite in armor. No grenades, no heavy weapons. Just the rage. As the tyrannid forms drew closer, I felt the black rage surge again, threatening to overwhelm the temporary clarity that had come with the relative quiet after the explosion. The visions pressed at the edges of my consciousness, memories of a death I had never experienced, a betrayal I had never witnessed firsthand. I did not fight it this time. Instead, I embraced it, let it flow through me like a crimson tide, washing away doubt, washing away fear. If I was to die on this emperor-forsaken rock, I would do so as a true son of Sanguineus, with the fury of the angel himself guiding my hand. The first of the tyrannid creatures reached me, a wounded gaunt, one of its sithing talons missing, icor still leaking from the stump, I met its charge with one of my own, ducking under its remaining talon and driving my combat knife up through the softer underbelly of its carapace. It thrashed in its death-throws, nearly wrenching the weapon from my grasp. More came, a mix of gaunts and the hybrid forms, surrounding me in a chittering circle of alien hunger. I fought with the abandon of one already dead, caring nothing for defense, everything for the kill. When my knife broke against the hardened carapace of a larger form, I fought with my armoured fists, with rocks torn from the ground, with the severed limbs of the fallen aliens themselves. Time lost all meaning in the red haze of combat. I existed only in the eternal now of bloodshed. Each moment isolated from the last, each kill a separate sacrament in the religion of war. I do not know how many fell to my fury. I do not know how many wounds I sustained. The black rage carried me beyond such mortal concerns. When Clarity returned again, I found myself standing alone amongst a circle of alien corpses. My armor so damaged, that it had ceased to function as a sealed environment. The toxic atmosphere of the moon entered freely through a dozen breaches, my enhanced physiology struggling to compensate. Blood, both mine and that of my enemies, pooled at my feet. The rage receded, not gone but temporarily sated by the slaughter. In its wake came pain, exhaustion, and the cold certainty of my fate. My mission was complete, but I was stranded on a dying moon, surrounded by an enemy that knew no mercy, no fear, no limitation save that of available biomass to consume. I would die here. This knowledge came not with fear or regret, but with a warrior's acceptance. Death had been my companion for two centuries of service. We were old friends, the Reaper and I. What troubled me was not the fact of my death, but its nature. The black rage had claimed me fully now. There would be no return to rationality, to the disciplined existence of a brother sergeant of the Adeptus Astartes. The next time the fury took me, it would not release its grip until my body failed entirely. In the chapter, brothers claimed by the Black Rage were gathered into the Death Company. Their armor repainted black, their names recorded as already dead. They were led into battle by the Chaplains, guided toward honorable deaths against the enemies of mankind. It was the last dignity afforded to those who succumbed to the floor, a final chance to die in service rather than madness. I would have no such dignity, no chaplain to guide my fury. No brothers to ensure my death served the Emperor, just the rage and the endless hunger of the tyrannid hive, unless I chose another path. My hand moved to a compartment in what remained of my armor. It was undamaged, the contents intact. The small vial of suppressant, my last dose. It would not cure the black rage, nothing could. But it might grant me a few more hours of clarity, enough time to determine my own fate, rather than have it decided by the alien or the curse in my blood. I removed my ruined helmet, letting the toxic air of Pertitus Secundus fill my lungs directly. It burned, but the pain was clarifying, a counterpoint to the rage that still simmered beneath the surface. The moon's sky was a sickly yellow, clouded by the spores and atmospheric corruption brought by the tyranid invasion. I raised the vial to my lips and drank, feeling the bitter liquid burn down my throat. The effect was almost immediate, the red haze receding further from the edges of my vision, the phantom memories of Sanguineus fading to whispers rather than shouts. With clarity came purpose. I would not die as a mindless beast, lost to the rage. I would not become biomass for the Tyranid Hive. I would die as a space marine, as a son of Sanguineus, on my terms. The mining complex had been destroyed, but there were other objectives on this moon that could serve the Emperor's will. The Tyranid invasion was centered around the main colony, its hive node established in what had once been the Governor's Palace. Intelligence had identified it as a secondary target, one that our main force under Captain Amalthus would assault after our sabotage mission was complete. I checked the remains of my equipment. My armor's power systems functioned intermittently, providing limited support to my movements. My Vox was damaged but might still be capable of short-range transmission. I had no functional ranged weapons, but my combat training made me lethal even unarmed. it would have to be enough. I set my course toward the colony, toward the heart of the alien infestation. If nothing else, I might provide a diversion, draw some of the tyrannid organisms away from the main imperial assault. Every alien that focused on me was one less facing my battle brothers. The journey was arduous. The landscape had been transformed not just by our sabotage, but by the ongoing tyrannid consumption of the moon's resources. What had once been relatively flat terrain was now broken by organic structures, the ground itself covered in a living carpet of alien growth that seemed to pull at my boots with every step. Several times I encountered tyrannid organisms, either scouts or stragglers from larger groups. I avoided combat where possible, slipping past them with the stealth training all blood angels received. When confrontation was unavoidable, I fought quickly and brutally, silencing the aliens before they could alert others to my presence. As I drew closer to the colony, the alien presence grew more dense. the buildings once imperial gothic in design had been consumed and reformed into structures that resembled nothing so much as giant calcified organs spires of bone-like material reached toward the sickly sky Pulsing, membranous sacks hung between them, their purpose unknowable but certainly vile. And everywhere, the tyrannids themselves. Gawntz patrolled in packs, their movements coordinated by the invisible hand of the hive mind. Larger warrior forms stood sentinel at key points, their bio-weapons alert for any threat to the colony. Above, gargoyles circled on leathery wings, their keen senses scanning the ground below. I took cover behind a twisted formation that might once have been a HAB block, considering my approach. A frontal assault would be suicide, even for an Astartes. But perhaps there was another way. During the mission briefing, the layout of the colony had been displayed, including the maintenance tunnels and sewage systems that ran beneath its streets. If those tunnels remained at least partially intact, they might provide a path to the heart of the hive node with minimal resistance. The tyrannids tended to focus their defenses on obvious approaches, their alien psychology sometimes blind to the subtler methods of warfare that humanity had perfected over millennia of conflict. I located a service entrance half buried in the alien growth that covered everything. The door was corroded and partially melted by xenobiological agents, but yielded to my enhanced strength after a brief struggle. Beyond lay darkness, the air thick with the stench of decay and alien biochemistry. I paused at the threshold, feeling the suppressant beginning to wear off. The visions were returning, faint but growing stronger. The red haze crept back into the periphery of my sight, I would not have long before the black rage claimed me again. But perhaps it did not need to be fought. Perhaps in these final hours, it could be directed. The death company chaplains did not cure the rage in their charges. They channeled it, turning the berserker fury toward the Emperor's enemies. Without a chaplain, I would have to be both the weapon and the hand that wielded it. I entered the darkness, moving by touch and memory more than sight. My armor's auto-senses were damaged, providing only intermittent readings, ghostly outlines in the absolute black of the underground passages. The tunnels were a maze, partially collapsed in places, in others transformed by the tyrannid occupation into something organic and horrific. I do not know how long I wandered those lightless corridors. Time had ceased to have meaning. The suppressant wore off completely, and the visions returned in force. But I maintained a fragile control, repeating the catechisms of hate taught by the chaplains, focusing the rage into a weapon I could direct, rather than a madness that directed me. Finally, I sensed rather than saw a change in the environment. a vast, open space ahead, dimly illuminated by bioluminescent growths. The central chamber of the hive node, what had once been the governor's palace. I approached cautiously, staying within the shadows of the access tunnel, and beheld the heart of the tyrannid infestation. The chamber was enormous, the ceiling lost in darkness high above. Every surface was covered in the same organic growth I had observed outside, but here it was thicker, more developed, pulsing with alien life. At the center stood a structure that defied easy description, a tower of flesh and chitin that reached toward the distant ceiling, covered in pulsating sacks and writhing tendrils. And surrounding it, tyrannids. Hundreds of them, of every variation I had encountered, and many I had not. Warriors, gaunts, hulking carnafixes, all arranged in concentric circles around the central structure, Not moving, not feeding. Simply, waiting. Dormant. It was then that I understood. This was not merely a hive node. This was a Norn Queen Chamber, the birthing place of new tyrannid organisms. The pulsating sacks on the central structure contained developing bioforms, the next generation of aliens that would consume this moon and then move on to other worlds. If it could be destroyed, the entire invasion might be crippled, giving the Imperial forces precious time to evacuate what remained of the colony's population, and perhaps even exterminatus the moon before the tyrannids could recover. But how? I had no explosives, no heavy weapons. Nothing that could significantly damage the central structure, let alone destroy it completely. And even if I did, the hundreds of tyrannid organisms surrounding it would tear me apart long before I could reach it. As I considered my options, a familiar sensation brushed against my mind. The psychic presence of the hive mind stronger here than anywhere else on the moon. But this time, instead of revulsion, I felt a strange resonance. The black rage within me, the genetic memory of Sanguinius's death, seemed to vibrate in harmony with the alien consciousness. A terrible idea began to form. The Tyranids were a psychic race, their organisms connected through the synapse, creatures to the greater hive mind. That connection was their strength, allowing them to function as a single organism, adapting and responding within human speed and coordination. But connections worked both ways. I had felt the hive mind touch my thoughts, had heard its alien voice in my mind, If it could reach into me, perhaps I could reach back. Not with psychic power, for I had none, but with the genetic curse that flowed in my veins. The black rage, the dying memories of a Primark, a psychic being of immense power. It was madness, of course. But I was already mad, claimed by the rage, living on borrowed time. And what did I have to lose that was not already forfeit? I moved further into the chamber, still hidden in the shadows, and found a place where I could observe the central structure clearly. Then I did what no son of Sanguineus is taught to do. I stopped fighting the rage. I embraced it fully, surrendering to the genetic memories, letting them flood through me in an uncontrolled torrent. The visions overwhelmed me completely. i was no longer brother sergeant darren vale i was sanguineous the great angel facing the warmaster aboard the vengeful spirit i felt his rage his sorrow his determination as he confronted his fallen brother I experienced his pain as the fatal blow was struck, the talon piercing his chest, the life bleeding from his magnificent form. But this time, instead of keeping these visions contained within my mind, I projected them outward with all the force my dying will could muster. I imagined them as a psychic scream, a blast of raw emotion and memory directed at the alien presence that surrounded me. The effect was immediate and catastrophic. The dormant tyrannids nearest to me began to twitch and spasm, their connection to the hive mind disrupted by the sudden influx of human emotion and memory. The spasms spread through their ranks like a wave, each organism affecting those connected to it, the disruption magnifying as it traveled. The psychic backlash struck me like a physical blow, driving me to my knees. Blood poured from my eyes, my nose, my ears, as as vessels ruptured under the strain. But still I projected the visions outward, giving everything I had left to this final act of defiance. The central structure itself began to pulse erratically, the sacks upon it rupturing one after another, spilling malformed tyrannid embryos onto the chamber floor. The tower swayed, tendrils lashing wildly as if in pain or confusion, and through it all, I felt the presence of the hive mind, no longer alien and distant but immediate and horrified. It had never encountered anything like the Black Rage before, had no defense against the raw emotional content of a Primarch's death. The genetic memory of Sanguineus, carried in my blood, was anathema to its cold, calculating consciousness. I do not know how long the psychic duel lasted. Time ceased to have meaning in that place between spaces, but eventually I felt something break. Not within me, but within the alien presence. A fracturing, a splintering of the unified consciousness that directed the tyrannid organisms. The effect on the physical creatures was immediate. Some collapsed entirely, their nervous systems burned out by the psychic feedback. Others turned on each other in mindless fury, tearing at their own kind with the same savagery they usually reserved for their prey. The more intelligent synapse creatures tried to restore order, but they too were affected, their actions uncoordinated, their purpose lost. As for the central structure, the presumed Norn Queen, it collapsed in upon itself, the tower of flesh and chitin folding like paper, the remaining sacks bursting in rapid succession. Whatever alien intelligence had directed its growth was gone, leaving only dead tissue that rapidly began to decay. I had succeeded beyond all hope or expectation. The Hive Node was destroyed. The Tyrannid force on Pertitus Secundus left leaderless and fragmented. They would still be dangerous, still fight with individual ferocity. But without the guiding intelligence of the Hive Mind, they would be unable to adapt, unable to coordinate their actions against the Imperial forces. But the victory had cost me everything. What remained of my enhanced body was failing rapidly, organs shutting down one by one, blood vessels continuing to rupture under the psychic strain. The black rage had consumed me entirely, burning through my system like Prometheum, leaving nothing but ashes in its wake. As darkness closed in around me, I saw a final vision, not of Sanguineus and his death, but of something else entirely. golden light, warm and welcoming. A presence vast and ancient, filled with both terrible judgment and infinite compassion. The Emperor, not as the corpse god worshipped by the masses, nor as the distant strategic genius revered by the Astartes, but as something more fundamental. The embodiment of humanity's potential, the guardian of its soul. I felt his gaze upon me, weighing my service, my sacrifice, my failures and triumphs alike, I awaited his judgment with the calm acceptance of a warrior who has given his all. What came instead was understanding, not forgiveness, for the Emperor forgives nothing and no one, but acknowledgement of a duty fulfilled to the bitter end, of a life spent in service to humanity's survival. As my consciousness faded for the final time, I heard words that might have been real or merely the hallucination of a dying mind. Even in death, you have served. Thus ended the life of Brother Sergeant Derren Vale of the Blood Angels, claimed by the Black Rage, lost on a forgotten moon at the edge of Imperial space. No Battlebrother witnessed my final moments. No chaplain recorded my name in the Book of the Fallen. My gene seed was not recovered to create future generations of the Angel's sons. But perhaps this record, this confession will survive in some form. Perhaps it will serve as both the warning and inspiration to those who follow the path of Sanguineus. The curse in our blood is real, brothers. The doom that awaits us all is certain. But even in damnation, there can be purpose. Even in madness, there can be sacrifice worthy of the angel's memory. We are all lost. We are all damned. But until the final breath leaves our bodies, until our hearts cease to beat, we can choose how we face that damnation. We can choose to make our inevitable falls serve the Emperor and humanity. Remember this, sons of Sanguineus, when the red thirst rises within you, when the black rage calls your name. You are never alone in that darkness. The memories of your Primarch go with you. And in the end, that shared damnation may prove to be our greatest weapon against the enemies of mankind. For the Emperor, for Sanguineus, for the blood we share.

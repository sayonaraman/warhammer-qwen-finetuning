The light of the Astronomican died 312 days ago. I record this final testament aboard the crippled void ship Memorium Imperialis, adrift in the outer reaches of what was once called the Ultima Segmentum. My name is Jerich Horn, former Imperial Remembrancer. Former. Because there is no Imperium left to remember. The ship creaks around me, its ancient hull plates contracting in the void's absolute cold. We lost life support in the starboard quarters during our escape from Ultramar. The ship's machine spirit struggles to maintain atmospheric integrity in what remains of our sanctuary. Seventeen souls survive aboard this vessel, though I suspect not for much longer. The orcs have won. Let history record this truth, should any remain to read these words. I remember the early days, when commanders dismissed reports from distant systems as exaggeration or the work of panicked minds. The Imperium had weathered countless wags before. Why should this one be different? That hubris would be our undoing, this war began like all others, on the fringes of imperial space. Border worlds reporting increased green-skin activity, disappearing trade vessels, the standard precursors. Then reports of previously disconnected Orc empires uniting under mysterious new leadership. Still, the High Lords barely stirred in their thrones. Even the fall of three hive worlds in the Ultima segmentum garnered little more than reinforcement requests and stern orders to contain the Xenos threat. But contain it we could not. I was stationed on Cardunayash when the first wave hit, documenting what should have been a routine suppression of heresy among the noble houses. The skies turned green with drop pods and crude landing craft. The planetary defense grid fired for six hours without pause, illuminating the night with lance strikes and defense battery flashes. We celebrated prematurely when the barrage seemed to stem the tide. Then came the sound. A great, collective roar that shook the very foundations of the Hive Spires. You cannot understand unless you have heard it yourself. The collective psychic manifestation of millions of orcs, unified in purpose, driven by primal joy at the prospect of battle. The sound broke men's minds. I watched hardened veterans drop their weapons and cover their ears, blood trickling between their fingers. That night I witnessed thirteen baneblades reduced to twisted metal by mobs of orcs who seemed to grow stronger with each imperial tank they destroyed. I watched a commissar execute thirty men for cowardice, before an orc with skin the color of dried blood lifted him with one hand and tore him in two. I ran, and I have been running ever since. This is not a mere invasion. This is not one wag among many. This is the culmination of the green-skin destiny, what they were created for eons ago. The Kroc reborn, their devolution reversed by war on a galactic scale. In the months that followed Carduniash, a pattern emerged. The orcs were not simply conquering worlds. They were transforming them, Imperial bastions became fighting pits. Hive cities transformed into crude factories producing more engines of war. Agri-worlds overtaken by squig farms. The orcs were not just destroying the Imperium, they were replacing it. Every defeat made them stronger. Every world that fell fed the war. As the green tide spread, orc specimens began to change. Larger, smarter, more organized. The appearance of beast-class orcs was reported on multiple fronts simultaneously. Entire companies of space marines dispatched to contain them never returned. We all assumed the Imperium eternal, unshakable. How wrong we were. The fall of Terra came 240 days ago. the cradle of humanity overrun by a green tide beyond counting, the Imperial Palace, 10,000 years of fortification, breached in 17 hours. The Emperor's throne room, desecrated. Whether the Golden Throne still functions, whether he still lives in some form, none can say. I dream of it sometimes. The golden spires blackened with smoke, the precision-cut stone replaced with crude metal plates and ram-shackle structures, the greenskins using custodians' helmets as drinking vessels, the eternity gate torn from its hinges, replaced with a crude arch of skulls and scrap metal. Gork and Mork's place crudely painted above, this is not a temporary setback, this is extinction. I have traveled far, documenting what I can. On Macharia, I watched Imperial citizens working alongside greenskins in monstrous factories, beaten into submission, no different from Grots in their master's eyes. On Cadia's ruins, I saw orcs using blackstone pylons as crude cover for blood sports. In the Tarsus sector, Astartes' armor adorned orc warbosses like trophies. The Inquisition is gone. The Space Marines scattered or destroyed, the Imperial Guard absorbed into slave labor or fighting pits, the Adeptus Mechanicus enslaved, forced to build ever more grotesque war machines for their conquerors. Mankind's light in this galaxy flickers and fades, but what truly haunts me is the realization that the Orcs have created something stable. Not civilization as we understand it, but a functioning ecosystem of endless war. Their crude factories outproduce forge worlds. Their squig farms feed vast populations. Their warbands continue to unite under a single galaxy-sized war. The orcs were made for war, and now they have all the war they could ever want. Forever. This is my testament. The last record of what befell the Imperium of Man. May the Emperor forgive us for our failure. The Voxcaster crackles. Another Orc vessel detected on long-range OSPEX. They hunt us for sport now. Like all others, we will eventually be found. The light of the Astronomicon is dead. Long live the green tide. Wait, something is happening. The ship's sensors have detected a massive energy signature moving through the system. It is unlike anything in our records. Not Orc. Not Imperial. Perhaps extinction is not yet certain. I will continue this record should we survive the night. Jerek Horn, Imperial Remembrancer, signing off. The stars seem colder now. I return to this chronicle, after witnessing what I can only describe as divine intervention, though which divinity I dare not guess. Three days have passed since my last entry. Three days of revelation and horror in equal measure. The energy signature detected by our failing awe-specs arrays revealed itself as a craft world, one of the great vessels of the Aildari. Massive beyond comprehension, it glided through the void with impossible grace, its wraithbone exterior reflecting the distant starlight in patterns that hurt the human eye to observe for too long. We expected destruction. Instead, we received an invitation. A single transmission. In perfect Gothic. The thread of your species has not yet been cut. Bored, if you wish to see what remains. Captain Lorimer, formerly of the Imperial Navy, counseled against accepting. Xenos Trickery, he called it. But what choice did we have? Our oxygen recyclers were failing. Our supplies nearly exhausted. Death by Eldar hands seemed preferable to slow suffocation in the void. We used the last of our fuel reserves to maneuver the Memorium Imperialis alongside the craft world. A docking portal opened like a wound in its side, admitting our crippled vessel into an internal bay large enough to house a battlecruiser. The air inside was sweet, almost intoxicating after months of recycled atmosphere. Figures awaited us, tall and graceful in their stillness. Eldar, their armor bearing the colors of Craftworld Ulthway, their leader, a female designated as Farsier Elethane, greeted us with cold courtesy. Your kind dies, she said, her voice musical even when speaking our crude language. But the pattern is not yet complete. Come, see what your Monke stubbornness has wrought upon the galaxy. They led us through crystalline, corridors to a chamber dominated by a holographic display of the galaxy. The sight struck me like a physical blow, where once the Imperium's territories had glowed with the light of a trillion human souls, now a virulent green consumed nearly everything. Small pockets of resistance remained, but they were dwindling rapidly. The Croc returned to their original purpose, the Farsier said. What you know as orcs were never meant to be mere savages. They were weapons, created for a war older than your species' first upright steps. That war ended, but the weapons remained, degraded over millennia. Now they remember. She manipulated the display, focusing on what had once been segmentum solar. Terror, the cradle of humanity swarmed with green-skin activity but it was not chaotic there was pattern purpose enormous structures reached from the surface into orbit crude in design but undeniably advanced in function The one you call the beast was merely the first stirring of memory. The Farsier continued, this is full awakening. The Primarchs coordinate across light years, their gestalt psychic field stronger than it has been since the war in heaven. They build, they grow, they unify. Soon, they will be unstoppable. And your people? Captain Lorimer asked. Will the Eldar fare any better than humanity? The Farsia's expression remained impassive, but I sensed sorrow beneath her mask of control. We delay, we evade, we survive, as we have always done, but we too face extinction eventually. The green-skin tide rises higher with each passing cycle, She showed us more. Astarte's fortress monasteries converted to fighting pits where captured space marines were forced to battle endless waves of orc challenges for the amusement of war bosses. Forge worlds where enslaved tech priests labored to produce grotesque hybrids of orc and human technology. Agri worlds transformed into vast breeding grounds for squigs and other orcoid lifeforms, but most disturbing were the human, collaborators. planetary governors who had surrendered their worlds in exchange for relative safety imperial citizens who now served orc masters helping to fuel the very war machine that had crushed their civilization survival at any cost the pharsia remarked with contempt your species most predictable trait for hours we watched the death of everything we had known the pharsia seemed to take no pleasure in our horror but neither did she offer comfort this was simply truth As the display shifted again, she spoke, you believe the orcs are mindless. This has always been your error. They possess a form of intelligence perfectly suited to their purpose. Where humans build to shelter, orcs build to accommodate more war. Where humans farm to sustain, orcs farm to feed fighters. Their entire biology, their society, their technology, all designed for perpetual conflict. And now, with no force left to oppose them effectively, they have achieved a terrible equilibrium. What do you mean? I asked. The Orcs have created a stable galactic ecosystem with themselves at the apex. Their war-driven technology advances rapidly. Their population replenishes instantly. Their psychic gestalt grows stronger with each world claimed. Even their squabbling serves a purpose, preventing stagnation. This is not temporary conquest. This is not an empire that will collapse under its own weight. This is the final state of the galaxy, unless something intervenes." Something like what? Lorimer demanded. The Farsier's eyes seemed to look through us, beyond us. That remains to be seen. They permitted us to remain aboard their craft world, though we were confined to specific areas. I continued my chronicle, recording everything I witnessed. The Eldar largely ignored us, though occasionally I would turn to find one watching me with inscrutable eyes. On the seventh day, the craft world's sensors detected a massive orc fleet moving through a nearby system. The Farsir summoned us again to the holographic chamber. Watch, she commanded. The display showed dozens, perhaps hundreds of orc vessels, crude but enormous. At their center flew a ship that defied comprehension, a space hulk the size of a small moon, its surface bristling with weapons. But what truly chilled my blood was the coordination. These were not the random movements of typical orc fleets. They moved with purpose, with strategy. They hunt us now, the Farsier said. The prime orcs have identified the craft worlds as threats to be eliminated. Three have fallen already. What will you do? I asked. We run, we hide, we survive. She paused, her perfect features hardening, and we take what opportunities we can to strike back. The display shifted again, showing a distant region of space. A small cluster of imperial worlds, somehow still free of the Ork conquest. Your species maintains a foothold here, in what you called the Eastern Fringe, Beyond the reach of your Astronomicon, these worlds were always semi-autonomous. Now, they represent the last significant human resistance. Captain Lorimer leaned forward suddenly alert. The Tao Empire borders that region. The Tao have their own difficulties, the Fars here replied dismissively. Their expansion has been halted, their worlds under constant assault. But yes, they fight still. As do elements of your Imperium, even some of your Astartes. Hope, fragile and dangerous, bloomed in my chest. You're taking us there. The Farsia's expression remained unchanged. We follow the threads of fate. Sometimes, those threads intersect with yours. The hologram zoomed in on one particular world, a harsh, mountainous planet with a single large continent surrounded by turbulent oceans. Redemption, the Farsia named it, one of your fortress worlds, now the center of human resistance in the sector. We will deliver you there in fourteen cycles. What happens afterward is no concern of ours. Why help us at all? Lorimer asked, suspicion heavy in his voice. For the first time, the Farsier smiled, though it held no warmth. The patterns of fate are complex. Sometimes, even the smallest pieces must be moved into position. With that cryptic statement, we were dismissed. The journey to redemption would take two weeks by the Eldar's reckoning. two weeks to prepare ourselves for whatever awaited us there. That night, I dreamed of terror again. But this time, beneath the crude, orcish structures built upon the ruins of the Imperial Palace, I sensed something stirring. something ancient and patient, waiting for the right moment to awaken. I woke, bathed in cold sweat, the dream slipping away like water between fingers, leaving only a lingering sense of dread and, strangely, anticipation. The galaxy belongs to the greenskins now, but perhaps, just perhaps, the final chapter has not yet been written. If only I could believe that. The craft world's movement through space defies conventional understanding. We experience no sensation of acceleration, no sense of velocity. Stars simply shift position outside the crystalline viewports, as if reality itself rearranges to accommodate our passage. During our journey, I have been permitted limited access to the Eldar historical archives, translated through some device they attach to my temples. The experience is disorienting, alien concepts filtering through a human mind, but I have learned much about our reluctant saviors and about the orcs themselves. The Kroc, as they were originally known, were created by the ancient beings called the Old Ones to serve as warriors in their war against the Necrontier and the Cotton. They were designed to be the perfect soldiers, physically powerful, instinctively skilled in warfare, capable of rapid reproduction, and with a gestalt psychic field that strengthened them in large numbers, Most importantly, they were designed to evolve rapidly in response to military challenges, becoming ever more formidable. As conflicts intensified, when the old ones vanished and the war in heaven ended, the Krak remained, but without purpose. Over millions of years, they devolved into the more bestial orcs, retaining their warlike nature, but losing much of their organization and technological sophistication. They became a galactic nuisance rather than an existential threat. Until now, the archives are unclear on what exactly triggered the Orcs' reawakening, Some Farsiers attribute it to the Great Rift that split the galaxy, others to the psychic emanations from combat on unprecedented scales during the Indomitus Crusade. Whatever the cause, the orcs began to change. The largest and most intelligent among them, those designated as prime orcs or beast-class specimens, started to recover ancestral memories, technological knowledge, and organizational abilities. The first signs were subtle, more sophisticated weaponry, more effective tactics, better coordination between clans. But as their successes mounted, the process accelerated. Victory feeds the Wage psychic field, which in turn accelerates evolution, which leads to more victories. A self-reinforcing cycle that, once started, proved impossible to stop. By the time the Imperium recognized the true threat, it was already too late. I reviewed records of the final battles with growing horror. Entire Astartes chapters obliterated, Titan legions brought low by swarms of crude but effective gargants. The Adeptus custodians making their final stand in the Imperial Palace, golden armor blackened with soot, fighting with unmatched skill but finally overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of the enemy. Most disturbing were the accounts of the Primarchs themselves, specimens reaching 12 meters in height. capable of strategic thinking that rivaled or exceeded human generals. Orcs developing technologies that incorporated warp-based principles, creating weapons that not even the Adeptus Mechanicus fully understood. Warbosses capable of coordinating actions across multiple star systems through their enhanced connection to the WAG field. This was not the random violence of feral predators. This was calculated conquest by an increasingly sophisticated enemy. The Eldar records show that they attempted to intervene several times, targeting key prime orcs for assassination, or manipulating human forces to strike at vulnerable points in the orc advance. But each attempt ended in failure. The orcs adapted too quickly, learned from each defeat, grew stronger from each challenge. They were made to win wars. Farsia Elethane told me when I questioned her about these failed interventions. That is their purpose, written into the very structure of their genes by the old ones. They were the final solution, the ultimate weapon. The old ones simply did not live long enough to witness their creation's true potential. Then what hope is there, I asked. She regarded me with those ancient alien eyes. Hope is a human concept, Remembrancer. We Eldari deal in probabilities, in the weaving of fate. Sometimes, the least likely thread is the one that must be followed. Today, the craft world's sensors detected a massive energy discharge from a nearby system, The Farseer summoned me to observe through their holographic displays. An Orc fleet had engaged a Necron tomb world that had awakened. The battle was unlike anything I had ever witnessed. Thousands of ships exchanging fire, planet-killing weapons unleashed with casual disregard, reality itself seeming to buckle under the forces being deployed. The Necrons fought with mechanical precision, their technological superiority evident in every exchange. But the orcs simply kept coming, absorbing losses that would have broken any human force, adapting their tactics continuously, learning from each defeat. And beneath it all, visible even to my untrained senses, the growing power of the wag field as the battle intensified. Watch closely, the Farsier instructed. This is the pattern repeating. For three hours, we observed the conflict. The Necrons destroyed five orc vessels for every one of theirs lost. Their ground forces cut through the Greenskin hordes with devastating efficiency, but gradually, inexorably, the tide turned. The orcs grew physically larger as the battle progressed. Their weapons became more effective. Their tactics more sophisticated. By the sixth hour, the Necron forces began to withdraw, Their orderly retreat, a tacit admission of defeat. The orcs pursued, howling their victory into the void. The silent king himself has failed to stem the green tide, the Farsier commented. Even the Necrons, with all their technological might, cannot overcome the orcs' fundamental nature. Each defeat makes the green skins stronger. Each challenge accelerates their evolution. It is as if the old ones designed a perfect weapon that improves itself indefinitely. Then the galaxy is lost, I said, despair threatening to overwhelm me. The galaxy changes, she corrected. Nothing is ever truly lost, Remembrancer. It merely transforms. We will reach redemption in three days. I do not know what awaits us there, what remains of humanity in this orc-dominated galaxy. But I continue this chronicle, this final testament of the Imperium's fall, in the hope that something of our civilization will survive, even if only as a memory. The stars watch impassively as empires rise and fall. Perhaps, in the grand scheme of creation, the dominance of the orcs is merely another phase, another turn of the Great Wheel. But for those of us living through this apocalypse, such philosophical comfort seems very cold indeed. The green-skin tide rises ever higher. And we, the last remnants of once mighty humanity, cling to whatever flotsam we can find in its wake. Redemption. The name tastes like bitter irony on my tongue. We arrived yesterday, the Eldar craft world hanging in orbit like a twisted shard of crystal against the void. The planet below appeared, unremarkable from space, its single continent, a mass of jagged mountains and deep valleys, with small patches of vegetation clinging to the lowlands. What made it valuable was its position, isolated yet within reach of several resource-rich systems, and its natural defensibility. The Farsia granted us use of a small transport vessel, clearly of human manufacture, though modified with Eldar technology, A gift, she called it, though her tone suggested it was more a means of removing us from her craft world than any genuine gesture of good will. As we prepared to depart, she approached me privately. You record the death of your species, Remembrancer, she said. A worthy task. But consider that what dies may also be reborn, though never in the form expected. Before I could question her further, she pressed a small crystalline device into my palm. When the moment comes, you will know how to use this. The device sits in my pocket now, cool against my skin, its purpose still unknown to me. Our descent to redemption was surprisingly uncontested. No orbital defenses fired upon us, no interceptors rose to challenge our approach. Captain Lorimer brought us down in a narrow valley, approximately 20 kilometers from the coordinates the Eldar had provided for the main human settlement. The air here is thin but breathable, the gravity slightly higher than Terra's standard. As we emerged from our vessel, the silence struck me first. After months aboard the noisy confines of void ships, the absolute stillness of this world seemed unnatural. No wind disturbed the sparse vegetation, no animals called in the distance. Only the sound of our own breathing and footfalls broke the perfect quiet. we established a small camp and debated our next move. Lorimer advocated caution, suggesting we send scouts ahead to assess the situation before approaching the settlement. Others argued for immediate contact, pointing out our limited supplies and vulnerability in the open. The decision was made for us when, as night fell, we observed lights moving along the ridge line above our position. Methodical, sweeping patterns. Search parties. They found us before dawn. Two dozen figures in battered Carapace armor, their helmets a mix of Imperial Guard and Space Marine designs, modified to accommodate rebreather units. Their weapons were similarly eclectic, everything from standard-issue lasguns to what appeared to be modified Aildari shuriken catapults. Their leader removed her helmet, revealing a face that might once have been beautiful, now scarred and weathered by hardship. Imperial refugees, she asked, her voice hoarse from disuse or damage. Lorimer stepped forward. Captain Holt Lorimer, Imperial Navy. We escaped the fall of Ultramar aboard the Memorium Imperialis. The Eldar brought us here. The woman's expression hardened at the mention of the Eldar. Those pointy-eared bastards playing their games again. She sighed, then gestured for us to follow. Come on. The Colonel will want to speak with you. They led us along hidden paths through the mountains, occasionally stopping to consult devices that appeared to monitor for specific energy signatures. Orc detectors, our guide explained when I inquired. The green skins have trouble finding us as long as we keep our power usage low, but their scouts drop in from time to time. We've gotten good at spotting them before they spot us. The main settlement, when we finally reached it, defied my expectations. Rather than a surface installation, it was built into the mountain itself, a vast network of natural caves and artificial tunnels. The entrance was concealed behind a holographic projection of solid rock, sophisticated technology that seemed beyond imperial capabilities. Tao Design, our guide explained, noticing my interest. We have a few of their Earthcasts working with us. Necessity makes for strange alliances these days. Inside, the settlement housed perhaps 5,000 souls, a mix of Imperial citizens, PDF troopers, guard regiments, even a handful of Astartes from different chapters, their once proud heraldry now subdued and darkened to avoid detection. I also noted several Tao moving among the humans, their blue-grey skin distinctive even in the dim lighting. The overall impression was one of desperate efficiency. Every space served multiple purposes. Every resource was carefully managed, weapons were everywhere, residents carrying everything from simple knives to plasma rifles, always within reach. Even the children, and there were surprisingly many, wore bandoliers of grenades or carried las pistols sized for their small hands. This was humanity reduced to its essence. No luxury, no waste. Only survival. The Colonel occupied a small chamber deep within the complex, its walls covered with maps and data slates. He was an old man, one arm ending in a cybernetic replacement of obvious tau design, his face deeply lined beneath close-cropped white hair. The insignia on his faded uniform identified him as Astra Militarum, though no regimental markings remained. Cadian 347th, he he said, noting my examination, not that it matters anymore. There is no cadia, no regiments, just survivors." He listened impassively as Lorimer recounted our journey, the fall of Ultramar, our rescue by the Eldar, and our arrival on redemption. When the captain finished, the colonel nodded slowly. Your timing is either providential or suspicious, he remarked. We have been preparing for a major operation. The first of its kind since the fall. What kind of operation? Lorimer asked. The Colonel activated a hololithic projector, displaying a nearby star system. This is Raxxis, two weeks' travel at maximum warp speed. It was a minor forge world before the fall. Now it's an orc manufacturing center. They've turned the entire planet into a weapons factory, churning out everything from crude sluggers to spacecraft components. He manipulated the display, zooming in on a particular facility. Our intelligence suggests this is where they're building a new class of flagship for one of the Primorks, a vessel that could potentially track down our remaining hidden settlements. You're planning to destroy it, Lorimer surmised. We're planning to steal it," the Colonel corrected. Or rather, critical components. The orcs have developed a new form of propulsion more efficient than standard warp travel. If we can acquire this technology, we might be able to evacuate to the galactic rim beyond the reach of the Greenskin Empire. That's your plan? I couldn't keep the disbelief from my voice. To run? The Colonel's gaze hardened. Our plan, Remembrancer, is to ensure humanity's survival. There are perhaps 50 million humans left alive in this galaxy, scattered across a hundred hidden settlements like this one. Once, we numbered in the trillions. We have lost everything. Our home, our empire, our future. All that remains is to preserve what little we can for as long as we can. And the Tao? Lorimer nodded toward a blue-skinned figure standing quietly in the corner. They share this goal? The Tao Empire is gone. The alien spoke, its accent making the Gothic words sound musical. The fourth sphere of expansion was our last. Now, we are fewer than the humans. Cooperation is logical. The orcs destroyed everyone equally, the Colonel added. Mankind, Tao, Eldar, even the Tyrannids. The Hive fleets were drawn to the massive psychic emanations of the Waa, only to be consumed by it. The Greenskins adapt faster than the Tyrannids can evolve. They grow stronger from each conflict, while every other race only diminishes. He shut down the hololithic display. You're welcome to join us, Captain Lorimer. We need skilled voidfarers. The mission launches in three days. And those who don't wish to participate, I asked. The colonel's expression softened slightly. No one is forced to fight, Remembrancer. But everyone contributes. Our survival depends on it. We were assigned quarters, small alcoves carved from the rock and separated by scavenged cloth hangings. Privacy is a luxury here, afforded only by mutual respect and necessity. The constant movement of people through the tunnels creates a background hum of activity that never truly ceases. That night, I lay awake, listening to the sounds of the last remnants of humanity going about their business. Children laughing somewhere distant, the clatter of weapons being maintained, voices raised in what might have been prayer or might have been argument. I thought of the Eldar Farsia's words, What dies may be reborn. The cryptic device she had given me remained cool in my hand as I turned it over and over, seeking purpose or meaning in its alien contours. Outside, beyond the mountain's protective embrace, the galaxy belonged to the orcs. Their empire of endless war stretching from one spiral arm to the next. Their crude efficiency transforming worlds into engines of conflict. Their biology ensuring that each battle only made them stronger. What hope could there be against such an enemy? What rebirth could possibly follow such complete destruction? Sleep eluded me for many hours. When it finally came, I dreamed of terror again. The Imperial Palace overgrown with fungal structures, the golden throne torn open like a gutted animal, and deep beneath it all, something ancient, stirring, awakening, reaching out across the stars with tendrils of cold purpose. I woke with the crystalline device clutched tight in my fist, its surface now warm against my skin, three days until the mission to Heracus. Three days to decide whether to join what might be humanity's last desperate act of defiance, or to remain here, recording our slow extinction for no one to read. The choice seems obvious when framed that way. Yet still I hesitate. Perhaps I have been running for too long. I volunteered for the mission. When survival is measured in days rather than years, Chronicler must become a participant in the history he records. The past two days have been consumed by preparation. Despite their limited resources, the Resistance on Redemption has developed impressive technological capabilities, much of it adapted from Xeno's designs. Their strike team will use a modified tau vessel, its hull reconfigured to mimic the energy signatures of Ork spacecraft. The boarding party consists of 20 individuals, an eclectic mix of former Imperial personnel and tau operatives. Captain Lorimer will pilot the vessel, his experience with void warfare deemed invaluable. The mission commander is a woman called Veldoran, apparently a former inquisitor, though she speaks little of her past. Among the team are three space marines from different chapters, their armor stripped of insignia and repainted in matte black. They keep to themselves, giants among the human operatives, their expressions unreadable behind their helmets. The Tao contingent is led by a scarred veteran they address as Shazvray, a title I understand denotes significant military rank. His right arm ends in a complex mechanical apparatus that appears to function as both a weapon and a tool. He regards the humans with what might be respect, though Tao facial expressions remain difficult for me to interpret. Our mission briefing was conducted in a chamber deep within the mountain complex, secure from any possible surveillance. The Colonel outlined our objectives with military precision. Raxis Orbital Shipyards Primary target is a prototype propulsion system being installed in the AUK flagship designated Gorkonaut Prime. Intelligence suggests the device incorporates technology beyond standard AUK capabilities, possibly adapted from captured Necron artifacts. Acquisition of this technology is our primary objective. Destruction of the shipyard is secondary but desirable. The hololithic display showed the orbital facility, a massive structure combining imperial architecture with crude orcish modifications. It hung in low orbit above what had once been a forge world, now transformed into a sprawling manufacturing center for the Greenskin War Machine. Our approach will utilize the confusion of the shipyard's normal traffic patterns, Veldoran explained. The orcs bring in salvage and components from across the sector. Our vessel has been modified to register as a typical transport on their primitive OSPEX systems. One of the Space Marines spoke. His voice a rumbling bass even without his helmet's vox amplification. The Greenskins will know we are not orcs the moment they see us. Correct, Veldoran acknowledged, which is why we won't be seen. The facility's external cameras have predictable blind spots, mapped by previous reconnaissance missions. We'll dock in one such location, using maintenance airlocks that the orcs largely ignore." The plan continued in similar detail. Insertion through maintenance corridors, neutralization of any orc overseers without raising alarms, identification and extraction of the propulsion technology, placement of explosives at key structural points, extraction via the same route, with contingency plans for multiple emergency scenarios. The primary challenge, the Tao Sha's Vra noted, will be the Mechboys, Unlike common orcs, they possess genuine technical understanding. They will recognize the value of what we seek to steal. How many mechboys are expected to be present? Lorimer asked. Unknown, Veldoran replied. At least three, possibly as many as twelve. They congregate around technology that interests them. The propulsion system will certainly qualify. The briefing continued for another hour, covering everything from communication protocols to the composition of Hraxis's atmosphere. When it concluded, we were dismissed to make our final preparations. I found myself in what passed for an armory, being fitted with a suit of carapace armor cobbled together from various sources. The technician, a young woman with burned scars covering half her face, moved with practiced efficiency. First time in the field? She asked, noting my discomfort with the armor's weight. I was a remembrancer, not a soldier, I admitted. She nodded, making a final adjustment to the chest plate. Everyone's a soldier now, the ones who weren't died already. She handed me a compact Las Pistol. Keep this close. If you see a green skin, aim for the eyes or the mouth. Their hide is too thick almost everywhere else. That night, our final one on redemption before the mission, I joined several team members in what they called the Commons, a larger cavern where the settlement's inhabitants gathered to share meals and information. The atmosphere was subdued but not despondent. Children played games in one corner while adults conversed in low voices. A makeshift still produced a harsh alcohol that was distributed in carefully measured portions. One of the space marines sat alone at the periphery, his massive frame making the salvaged furniture seem child-sized by comparison. Without his helmet he appeared younger than I expected, though his eyes held the weight of centuries. The insignia on his shoulder pad had been obscured, but faint traces of crimson suggested blood-angels' heritage. I approached cautiously, conscious of the traditional distance maintained between Astartes and ordinary humans. To my surprise, he gestured for me to join him. The chronicler, he said, You bear witness to our last days. I record what I see, I replied, though I wonder if anyone will ever read it. Someone always remains to read the histories, he said. Even after the greatest catastrophes, that is the nature of life. It endures. Even against the orcs? I couldn't keep the skepticism from my voice, especially against the orcs. He took a drink from a container that would have been a bucket in human hands. They are formidable, but not invincible. They were created, just as we were. And what is, created can be destroyed. You sound almost hopeful. Hope is irrelevant. Ideal uncertainties, the certainty of duty, the certainty of battle. He set down his drink. And the certainty that the galaxy's current state is not its final one. Before I could question him further, an alarm sounded, three short pulses that sent everyone into immediate motion. Children were hurried away, weapons were distributed, and defensive positions established with practiced precision. Proximity alert, someone explained as they rushed past. Potential orc scouts in the area. For six tenths hours, the settlement remained on high alert. Scans detected what might have been an orc recon vessel passing through the system, It performed no detailed survey, however, and eventually jumped to warp, apparently continuing on a routine patrol route. The Colonel ordered preparations for the mission to proceed regardless. If they suspected anything, they would have deployed forces immediately, he reasoned. Subtlety is not the green-skin way. As dawn broke on our final day on redemption, I found myself drawn to a small alcove near the settlement's hidden entrance where a makeshift shrine had been established. It contained no images of the emperor, no imperial iconography at all. Instead, simple objects had been arranged in patterns that held meaning only to those who placed them there. Scraps of cloth, pieces of broken equipment, small, carved figures representing loved ones lost. This was faith stripped to its essentials. Not worship of a distant god figure, but remembrance of what had been lost. Devotion not to an empire, but to the idea that something of humanity should continue. I placed my hand in my pocket, feeling the crystalline device the Eldar Farsia had given me. Its purpose remained mysterious, but its weight had become strangely comforting. A reminder that even in this orc-dominated galaxy, other forces still moved, other plans still unfolded. The mission departs in two hours. I write these words not knowing if I will return to continue this chronicle. If I fall, perhaps another will take up the task. The human story must not end, even if human civilization has. The stars grow cold as the green tide rises, but somewhere embers still burn. I continue this record against all odds and reason. Three days have passed since our mission to Raxis. Three days of revelation, horror, and strange, unexpected hope. our insertion proceeded according to plan our modified vessel slipping into the crowded approach lanes around the orbital shipyard without challenge captain loremou's skill at the controls was remarkable mimicking the erratic flight patterns of all craft while maintaining precise course adjustments the shipyard itself defied easy description What had once been an imperial naval facility had been transformed into something that straddled the line between technological marvel and abomination. Crude-awkish modifications jutted from elegant imperial architecture like tumors. Green and red warning lumens bathed everything in a sickly glow. The sound was overwhelming. A constant cacophony of metal-on-metal, bellowed orders in the guttural orc tongue, and the occasional explosion followed by raucous laughter. We docked in a maintenance bay that appeared largely abandoned, its airlocks functioning but clearly unused for their original purpose. The orcs had repurposed the space as some kind of waste disposal area, mountains of scrap and discarded machinery, providing convenient cover for our insertion. The boarding party split into three teams as planned. The first, led by Veldoran, would locate and secure the propulsion technology. The second, commanded by the Tao Shasvrur, would place explosives at key structural points. The third, consisting of the three space marines, would create a diversion if necessary to cover our extraction. I accompanied Veldoren's team, recording what might be humanity's last significant act of resistance. We moved through maintenance corridors where even the orcs rarely ventured, guided by schematics recovered from previous reconnaissance missions. The air was thick with the green skin stench, a combination of unwashed bodies, fungal growth, and machine oil that burned the nostrils and made each breath an exercise in controlled revulsion. We encountered few orcs in these peripheral areas. Those we did were usually alone, often smaller specimens assigned to menial tasks. Our team neutralized them quickly and silently, hiding the bodies to avoid raising alarms. The central construction bay, however, presented a different challenge entirely. Here, dozens of orcs swarmed over the partially completed flagship, a vessel of such monstrous proportions that it dwarfed even the largest imperial battleships I had ever witnessed. It resembled a floating fortress more than a spacecraft, its hull bristling with weapons beyond counting, and at its heart, surrounded by a cluster of attentive mech boys, lay our target, the propulsion system pulsed with an eerie blue-green light that seemed to bend the space around it. It was clearly not of orcish manufacture, its elegant lines and crystalline components, standing in stark contrast to the crude machinery surrounding it. Necron technology, Veldoran whispered, her voice tight with recognition. As we suspected, the orcs have somehow adapted a necron inertialist drive for their own use. Can we remove it? one of the team asked. Veldoran studied the device through magnoculars. Not in its entirety, but those control crystals, there and there, contain the operational principles. With those, our techs could potentially replicate the technology. We waited for a shift change, a brief period of relative confusion as one group of orcs replaced another. During this window, two of our team, wearing specialized stealth fields of tau design, slipped onto the walkway surrounding the propulsion system. They worked with swift precision, extracting the specified components and replacing them with convincing duplicates that would pass casual inspection. the mission had proceeded almost too smoothly we should have recognized the trap as we began our withdrawal alarms suddenly blared throughout the facility not in response to our intrusion however external alarms warning of an approaching vessel Through a viewport, I glimpsed a ship of unmistakable design, its wraithbone hull gleaming in the light of Hraxis's Sunday Eldar. A sleek destroyer, moving with impossible grace through the Orc defense grid, drawing fire and attention away from the shipyard itself. A diversion, Veldoran realized. The Eldar are creating a diversion for us. We used the confusion to accelerate our extraction, linking up with the Tau team as planned. They had successfully placed their explosives set to detonate once we were safely away. The Space Marine team, however, was late to the rendezvous. Vox communications, limited to begin with in the signal-saturated environment of the shipyard, brought only fragments of explanation. Something about significant resistance and unexpected discovery. Lorimer made the difficult decision to extend our extraction window by 15 minutes, no more. Any longer would risk the entire mission. The Space Marines arrived with only moments to spare, bursting through a maintenance hatch with weapons smoking from recent discharge. They carried between them a stasis pod of imperial design, clearly heavy even for their transhuman strength. What is that? Veldoran demanded as we hurried back to our vessel. Salvation, one of the Astartes replied cryptically. If we survive to deliver it, our extraction was considerably less subtle than our insertion. The orcs had begun to realize something was amiss, and our departure coincided with a general increase in security awareness throughout the shipyard. Lorimer was forced to engage in direct combat, utilizing our vessel's limited weapons to clear Oppressenotions to and stern, path through suddenly alert orc interceptors. The Eldar ship provided unwitting assistance, its superior maneuverability drawing much of the orc firepower. I do not know if they sacrificed themselves intentionally for our mission, or if their appearance was merely fortuitous timing. Either way, their intervention likely saved our lives. As we cleared the shipyard's defensive perimeter, the explosives detonated. The resulting chain reaction was beyond our most optimistic projections. The entire central section of the facility collapsed in on itself, tearing the incomplete flagship apart and sending debris cascading into Hraxis's upper atmosphere in a fiery display visible from the surface. Our return journey to redemption was tense but uneventful. The Orcs, for all their newfound organization, still lacked the ability to track small vessels effectively through the warp. Their resources were committed to large-scale warfare, not the pursuit of individual raiders. Upon our return, the Colonel immediately convened a secure briefing. The propulsion crystals were transferred to the settlement's research team, a mixed group of former Adeptus Mechanicus personnel and Tau Earthcast engineers. Initial analysis confirmed our assessment. They were indeed adapted Necron technology, promising vastly improved interstellar travel capabilities once properly understood and replicated. But it was the contents of the stasis pod that dominated the briefing. The Space Marines had discovered it in a secure chamber adjacent to the flagship's construction bay, apparently being studied by a conclave of the most senior Mechboys. Inside was a human, or what had once been human. A withered figure, ancient beyond reckoning, its flesh a parchment stretched over bone, sustained only by archaic life-support systems integrated into the pod itself. Yet the mind remained active, detectable by psychic senses as a powerful presence despite the body's decay. A primarist Psyche, the blood angels, Astartes explained, of exceptional power. The orcs were studying him, experimenting. They seemed to believe he represented some threat to them. The pod's external data slate contained fragmentary records identifying the subject as an astropath transcendent who had served in the Imperial Palace itself. The date of his interment in the Stasis pod predated the fall by several years. Why the orcs had preserved him rather than simply killing him remained unclear. The greenskins fear something about him, The Space Marine continued, or rather, what he represents. Our brother librarian sensed recognition from the Mechboys. They called him Hume Weird Boss, and treated the pod with unusual caution. The Colonel regarded the ancient figure with skepticism. What value does this have for our mission? We needed propulsion technology, not another mouth to feed. He is more than he appears, the Astartes insisted, much more. Our librarian believes he may be a direct conduit to the Emperor's power, preserved from terror before its fall. The claim hung in the air, simultaneously absurd and tantalizing. A direct connection to the Emperor, even after the fall of terror and the desecration of the Golden Throne, it seemed impossible. Yet the Space Marine's conviction was absolute. The settlement's senior medicare was summoned to examine the pod and its occupant. Her assessment was grim. His physical condition is terminal. The stasis field has preserved him but only barely. If we remove him from the pod, death would be instantaneous. Can he communicate? the colonel asked. Unknown. Brain activity is present but abnormal. Whether that represents conscious thought or merely autonomic function is impossible to determine without more sophisticated equipment than we possess. The decision was made to maintain the Stasis pods operation while further study was conducted, the propulsion technology remained our primary focus, offering tangible hope for evacuation to regions beyond the Orcs reach. Yet something about the ancient Psyker nagged at my thoughts. That night, alone in my quarters, I again examined the crystalline device given to me by the Eldar Farsia. Its surface seemed to pulse faintly in the dim light, resonating with something or someone. On impulse, I brought it to the chamber where the stasis pod had been secured. The guards, recognizing me from the mission team, permitted my entry. Alone with the ancient figure, I held the Eldar device close to the pod's transparent panel. The reaction was immediate and startling. The crystal flared with brilliant light, and the withered form within the pod convulsed once, violently. Then, a voice filled my mind, neither human nor Eldar, neither male nor female, but something both ancient and familiar. the circle closes, the wheel turns, what was sundered shall be made whole. Visions flooded my consciousness. Terror, not as it was in its final days, but as it might be again. The Imperial Palace restored, but different, incorporating elements of all the galaxy's cultures in a harmonious whole, humans walking alongside Tao, Eldar, even species I did not recognize, and above it all, a golden light, not the searing brilliance of the Emperor as imperial propaganda portrayed him, but a warm, nurturing radiance that embraced rather than dominated. Then darker images, the orcs, not defeated, but transformed, their warlike nature channeled into protective rather than destructive purposes, their endless energy harnessed to build rather than destroy, their adaptability turned toward cooperation rather than domination. Most shocking of all, I saw the golden throne, not as a prison for a withered corpse god, but as a nexus point where psychic energy flowed freely between dimensions. The Emperor, or what remained of him, no longer trapped but expanded, His consciousness spread throughout the galaxy, touching all sentient minds regardless of species. The vision ended as suddenly as it had begun, leaving me gasping on the floor of the chamber. The crystal in my hand had shattered, its purpose apparently fulfilled. The ancient Psyche in the Stasis pod appeared unchanged, yet somehow I sensed he was more at peace. I told no one of this experience. Who would believe me? Yet it changed everything. What had seemed like humanity's last desperate act of defiance now appeared as part of a larger pattern, a cosmic realignment that transcended the concerns of any single species. The orcs had won, yes, but perhaps their victory was merely one turn of the great wheel of existence. Perhaps what comes after might be something none of us could have imagined. Two weeks have passed since our return from Heraxis. The research team has made significant progress with the propulsion technology, confirming its viability for our evacuation plans. Preparations are underway for a mass exodus, not just from redemption but from all known human settlements in the sector. Yet I find myself reluctant to join this flight to the galactic rim. Something holds me here. Some sense that events have not yet reached their conclusion. The ancient Psyker remains in his stasis pod, unchanged outwardly, but I sense a growing awareness within him, a gathering of purpose that resonates through the settlement like a subsonic vibration, felt rather than heard. Others have begun to notice it too. The space marines stand vigil by the pod for hours at a time, communing in some unspoken way with its occupant. The Tao regard it with growing unease, sensing something beyond their philosophical framework. Even the children of the settlement have started leaving small tokens around the chamber housing the pod, responding to some instinct they cannot articulate. Yesterday, long-range sensors detected a massive energy surge from a nearby system. Initial analysis suggested orc weapons fire on an unprecedented scale, but further examination revealed something else entirely. A warp storm of impossible proportions had erupted, swallowing an entire Orc fleet in its moor. Similar reports have begun filtering in from our limited network of contacts across the sector. Warp anomalies, unexplained phenomena, Orc forces suddenly turning upon each other without apparent cause. The galaxy holds its breath, awaiting some cosmic turning point. And here, in this forgotten corner of what was once the Imperium of Man, I sense we are somehow at the center of it all. I continue this chronicle, though I no longer know for whom. Perhaps for the future. Perhaps for no one. But the act of recording itself has meaning. bearing witness to these final days. Or perhaps, if the vision I experienced has any truth to it, not final days at all, but the birth pangs of something new, the green tide rose, it swept away the old order. But now, perhaps, the tide recedes, leaving behind a changed landscape where new growth might take root. I am Jerich Horn, Imperial Remembrancer, The last, perhaps, but maybe also the first of something else. The chronicler not just of an ending, but of a beginning. The light of the Astronomican died 312 days ago, but other lights now kindle in the darkness. Whether they will grow to illuminate a new path for the galaxy, only time will tell. For now, we endure, we witness, we remember, and perhaps, against all odds, we hope. The wheel turns, the circle closes, what was sundered shall be made whole. I write now in haste, events unfolding faster than I can properly document them. Three days have passed since my last entry, days of miracle and terror in equal measure. It began with the ancient Psyche. His stasis pod suddenly activated emergency protocols, its internal systems reconfiguring to accommodate some change in his condition. The settlements medicaid were baffled, the technology beyond their understanding. The Space Marine Librarian described sensing a psychic supernova building toward detonation and ordered the chamber evacuated. Only the blood. Angels Astartes remained, standing guard around the pod as its occupant underwent some profound transformation. through the transparent panel i witnessed the withered body begin to glow from within a golden luminescence that grew steadily brighter until it became painful to look upon directly then came the first tremor not a seismic event but a ripple through reality itself Every Psyker in the settlement collapsed simultaneously, blood flowing from their eyes and ears. The Tao clutched their heads in pain, their connection to their species limited group consciousness suddenly overwhelmed by something greater. The Space Marines alone seemed prepared, almost expectant. It begins, the librarian intoned, his voice carrying an uncharacteristic note of awe. The Emperor protects. Outside the mountain complex, the sky split open. There is no other way to describe it. A vertical wound in reality tore from horizon to zenith, golden light spilling through like the dawn of creation itself. Through this impossible aperture, shapes moved, massive and indistinct, trailing streamers of energy as they entered our dimension. Long-range sensors went offline immediately, overloaded by readings that defied categorization. Short-range systems detected multiple massive objects materializing in orbit around redemption, their energy signatures unlike anything in our databases. The Colonel ordered battle stations, though what defense we could mount against such phenomena seemed questionable at best. Evacuation protocols were initiated simultaneously, our limited transport vessels prepared for emergency departure. Then the Vox system crackled to life, broadcasting on all frequencies simultaneously. The voice that emerged was impossible, simultaneously intimate and infinite, speaking directly into the mind while resonating through the physical medium. Children of Terra, children of Tao, children of Eldari, children of all the stars. The long night ends, the new day dawns. the language was gothic yet every person reported hearing it in their native tongue understanding it at a level beyond mere words the voice continued its message simple yet profound what was separated shall be united what was broken shall be healed The weapons of old become the tools of renewal. The tide recedes. The circle closes. In the chamber housing the stasis pod, a transformation had completed. The ancient vessel of flesh had been consumed entirely by the golden light, which now coalesced into a form both human and more than human, its features indistinct yet somehow familiar to all who beheld it. Not the emperor, as imperial iconography depicted him, not a god-figure of impossible majesty, but something else, a nexus of consciousness, a focal point where multiple dimensions intersected. Through it, I sensed other presences, watching, participating, the ascended souls of Primarchs, the god entities of other species. Even the collective gestalt of the Orc race, their innate psychic field suddenly redirected toward a purpose beyond endless war. The being spoke again, its voice resonating through every molecule of the settlement. The work begins now. Those who would participate, step forward. Those who would observe, stand aside. Those who would oppose, know that the tide of creation flows against you. Outside, the objects in orbit revealed themselves, manifesting fully in our reality. Ships of impossible design, combining elements of every species' architecture in harmonious function. From them descended smaller craft, landing in the valleys surrounding our mountain refuge. The colonel, ever cautious, dispatched scouts to observe. They returned with reports that defied belief. The craft contained representatives of a dozen species, some familiar, others unknown to human experience. All moved with common purpose, establishing equipment of advanced design across the landscape. Terraforming technology, the Tau Earth cast engineers concluded after studying the sensor readings. But beyond anything our species ever developed, they are transforming this world, accelerating natural processes a thousandfold. Within hours, visible changes had begun. Barren valleys bloomed with vegetation. Poisoned groundwater ran clear and sweet. The very air seemed richer, charged with vital energy that invigorated all who breathed it. The being that had emerged from the stasis pod moved among us, its form shifting subtly to appear less alien to whomever it addressed. To humans, it appeared human. To Tao, it reflected their proportions. Even the space marines, genetically engineered to revere the Emperor above all, saw in it something of their Primarchs' countenance. It explained, in concepts more than words, what had transpired. The fall of the Imperium had been necessary, the dominance of the Orcs inevitable. Both represented phases in a cosmic cycle that had turned countless times before. The galaxy periodically reset itself, purging the accumulated weight of war and hatred, clearing space for new growth. The orcs, as the perfect weapons created for the war in heaven, were the unwitting instruments of this reset. Their nature drove them to tear down the calcified empires that had grown rigid with age. Their psychic gestalt, once it reached a critical mass, became the channel through which greater powers could work. The old ones knew, the being told us, they built the cycle into their creations, the weapons that would clear the field for new life to flourish. Now that cycle had turned again. The Orcs had not been defeated, they had been fulfilled. Their purpose complete. Their Gestalt psychic field was being redirected. Their biological imperatives shifted from destruction to creation. Already, reports indicated Orc forces across the galaxy laying down weapons. Their aggressive nature subsumed into a greater purpose they themselves barely comprehended. Not all would change, of course. There would still be conflict. Still, be struggle. The fundamental nature of existence remained unaltered, but the scale had rebalanced. The pendulum swung from destruction toward creation. Most stunning of all was the revelation about the Emperor. He had not been defeated when terror fell, had not been destroyed when the Golden Throne was breached, he had been released. The physical vessel that had constrained his consciousness for 10,000 years had finally failed, allowing his essence to expand throughout the warp, becoming one with the psychic consciousness of humanity and beyond. What emerged was neither the corpse god of imperial dogma nor the secular leader of imperial truth. It was something far older and far newer, a principle of organization within the chaotic warp. a nexus of consciousness that transcended species and faction. And now, through the ancient Psyche who had served as his final conduit, this consciousness was manifesting across the galaxy, using the very psychic network the orcs had established to reshape reality itself. The future revealed itself in glimpses. Humanity would survive, though changed. The Tao would continue their expansion, though with wisdom tempered by recent tragedy. The Eldar might find redemption, their fractured society healed by new purpose. Even the Necrons, ancient and implacable, might rediscover something of their lost souls in the new order. And the Orcs? They would remain the Orcs, their nature unchangeable at its core. But their endless energy would find new expression, their joy in creation matching their former joy in destruction. The perfect weapons would become perfect builders, though still crude, still boisterous, still recognizably themselves. The wheel turns. The being concluded. What comes now has come before and will come again, but each turning brings new patterns, new possibilities. This is the nature of existence. As I write these words, the transformation of redemption continues apace. The mountain that housed our hidden, settlement now blooms with life unlike anything in imperial records. The skies above fill with vessels of the new order, their design principles beyond our comprehension yet somehow familiar to our souls. Most of the settlement's population has chosen to participate in the work, joining the mixed species teams, establishing the foundation of whatever comes next. A few, unable to abandon old hatreds and fears, have departed in our evacuation vessels, seeking isolation on the galactic rim. I do not condemn them. Change comes harder to some than others. The space marines surprised me most of all. To a man they laid down their weapons and stepped forward to serve this new manifestation of the being they had worshipped for millennia. They recognized in it the true fulfillment of their Primarchs' vision, not the corrupted Imperial Creed that had calcified around the Emperor's wounded form. We were made to protect humanity. The blood angels Astartes told me as he removed his armor for the final time. Not from Xenos, but from extinction. That purpose remains unchanged. Only the method differs. I have been asked to continue my work as Remembrancer, though with an expanded purpose. no longer recording only humanity's story but the intertwined narratives of all sapient species as we move into this new age. It is a task beyond any single lifetime, but I have been assured that time now flows differently for those who choose to perceive it fully. The green tide rose, crested, and now recedes, leaving behind not destruction but transformation. The Orcs won, yes. But in winning, they fulfilled their purpose and transcended it, becoming participants in creation rather than mere agents of war. And we, the survivors of the old order, find ourselves not at an ending but at a beginning. The wheel turns, the circle closes, what was sundered is made whole. I am Jerich Horn, no longer merely an imperial remembrancer but a chronicler of the new age. These words mark not the final, chapter of humanity's story, but the first pages of a greater narrative, one that encompasses all children of the stars in a single, continuing saga. The light of the Astronomican died 312 days ago, but a new light dawns, brighter and more inclusive than any that came before. And in that light, even the shadows cast by the green tide find their proper place in the pattern of existence, I continue my watch. I continue my record. I continue. The wheel turns. The circle closes. The story never ends.

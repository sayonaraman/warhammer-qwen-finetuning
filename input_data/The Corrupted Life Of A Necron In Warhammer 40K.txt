The terrifying life of necrons is not what you imagine. I have lived 10 million years in a prison of living metal, my soul a fading echo, my memories fracturing like ancient stone. I remember warmth, I remember pain, I remember joy. These are the cruelest tortures of immortality, to remember what it means to be alive while being forever dead. What happens when a machine designed never to feel begins to remember what it once was? Overlord Aketsaren. A name I once wore with pride, now merely a designation in an endless hierarchy of silent rulers. How long had I slumbered in this tomb world? Chronometric data scrolled through my consciousness, numbers so vast they held no meaning. Time measured in geological epochs, rather than the brief seasons I once knew as mortal. The servitors continued their work, mindless constructs of living metal that repaired the microscopic degradation of my form. I watched their spindly limbs with detachment, these lesser machines that maintained my prison of immortality. Once, perhaps, they too, had names, identities, souls. Now they were merely extensions of the tomb world's will. as was i i commanded my form to rise necrodermis responding with perfect obedience no pain no stiffness no sensation but the cold efficiency of movement around me the stasis chamber hummed with ancient technologies beyond the comprehension of the young races that now crawled across the galaxy Green light pulsed through crystalline conduits, power flowing from sources that would outlast stars. Memory engrams flickered like dying flames, fragments of a life-long surrendered. I remembered a palace of white stone beneath three moons. I remembered the taste of sweet wine in a goblet of precious metal. I remembered the touch of attendance as they draped my mortal form in robes of office. All sensations now reduced to data, cold and precise, archived in the quantum networks of my mechanical brain. I stepped from the dais, each movement a silent mockery of life. The chamber recognized my awakening, illuminating pathways through the vast tomb world. my tomb world my kingdom of dust and silence buried beneath the surface of a planet whose name i could no longer recall systems engage i spoke my voice no longer the resonant command of a living ruler but the synthetic approximation of speech transmitted through arcane technologies Status Report. The Tomb World's intelligence responded, not in words but in data streams that flowed directly into my consciousness. Awakening protocols were initiating throughout the vast underground complex. Warriors were rising from stasis. Constructs were activating. Defense systems were coming online. War was coming to my domain. After countless millennia of dormancy, my legions would march again. But for what purpose? To serve whom? The questions rose unbidden in my consciousness, errant thoughts that should have been purged during the biotransference. Such doubts were imperfections in the grand design, weakness of the flesh persisting in the perfect immortality of the machine. I moved through silent corridors of living metal, the walls themselves responding to my presence. the tomb-world awakened around me a slumbering leviathan stirring to terrible purpose in the great awakening chambers i witnessed rank upon rank of warriors rising from their crypts mindless automatons of destruction their emerald eyes ignited in unison as power surged through their frames once they had been my people nobles artisans scholars soldiers now they were merely weapons their identities erased their souls long since consumed in the great transference i gazed upon their identical faces searching for some trace of the beings they had once been There was nothing. Only the cold, implacable mask of death. Yet I remembered them. Fragments. Shards of memory that cut like obsidian through the ordered pathways of my mechanical mind. Names. Faces. Voices. Beloved advisors. Loyal generals. Even family, though the concept now seemed foreign, a biological imperative no longer relevant to my existence. What cruel twist of fate had preserved these memories while so much else was lost? Was it a flaw in my biotransference, or some deliberate torment designed by the kataan who had orchestrated our transformation, to remember warmth when doomed to eternal cold, to recall love when incapable of feeling, to know what was lost, forever beyond recovery? A subordinate cryptic approached, its hunched form moving with mechanical precision, Once a master of sciences beyond mortal comprehension, now a technician maintaining the machinery of undeath. It communicated not in words but in data bursts, informing me of the tomb world status, of detection systems identifying intrusion, of defense protocols engaging. The nature of the intruders, I inquired, though the answer mattered little. All life was anathema to our kind now. all warmth and affront to our cold immortality. The data flowed, imperial, human explorers perhaps, or archaeological expeditioners, scavengers seeking treasures they could not possibly understand. Their presence had triggered the awakening protocols, rousing the tomb world from its long dormancy. Prepare the legions, I commanded. Full awakening sequence, defense patterns omega null, The cryptic acknowledged and withdrew to execute my orders. I remained, watching as more warriors rose from their crypts, endless ranks of soulless soldiers ready to march at my command. A memory surfaced, unbidden and unwelcome, the day of the great betrayal, the moment of transformation. The agony as flesh was rendered down, as consciousness was torn from failing bodies and imprisoned in shells of living metal. the silent scream of an entire species as their souls were devoured. I remembered standing before the bio-furnaces, watching as my people marched willingly into oblivion, believing the lies of immortality, trusting in my judgment as their Lord and protector. I remembered the pride I had felt, the sense of triumph over death itself, What fools we had been, what desperate, arrogant fools. The great hall of awakening stretched before me, countless crypts opening to disgorge their occupants. An army without peer in the galaxy, warriors who could not die, who felt no pain, who knew no fear. An army of the damned, marching to my will alone. And I, their lord, as damned as they. Perhaps more so, for I remembered what we once had been. I carried the burden of knowledge they had been spared. This was the terrifying truth of our existence. Not the horror of death, but the horror of unending life without purpose or meaning. Immortality without joy. Existence without sensation, power without triumph. As my legions assembled, I ascended to the command dais, overlooking the gathering host. Row upon row of identical warriors, their vacant eyes staring forward, awaiting orders. They would follow me without question, without hesitation, without thought, perfect soldiers for a perfect war. But to what end? To preserve tomb worlds that housed nothing but dust and echoes? To exterminate the living whose only crime was to possess what we had surrendered? To serve gods we had overthrown, whose betrayal matched our own. These questions found no answers in the cold logic of my mechanical brain. They were relics of mortality, useless inquiries born of a consciousness that still remembered choice, still remembered purpose beyond mere existence. I surveyed my silent kingdom and issued the command to march, the first step in an endless war, a conflict without victory or defeat, merely the cold execution of protocols established eons ago. I was the first to be able to do this. My warriors moved as one, a tide of living metal flowing through ancient corridors toward the surface, toward the warmth of living beings who would soon know the touch of death. And I followed, a king of dust leading an army of shadows, remembering the taste of wine I would never again savor, the touch of sunlight I would never again feel, the sound of laughter I would never again hear. This is the terrifying truth of the Necrons. We do not fear death, for we have already died. We fear only the endless march of time, the weight of memory, and the cold eternity that stretches before us, devoid of all that once made existence worthwhile. The tomb world trembled as ancient mechanisms activated, stone and earth shifting as pathways to the surface opened for the first time in millennia. Soon we would emerge into the light of an unfamiliar sun, bringing darkness in our wake. The living awaited. Soon they would envy the dead. Word counts so far, 1,456. The surface of the world that housed my tomb was unrecognizable. Once, I recalled, it had been a verdant paradise of azure seas and emerald forests, where great beasts roamed and the skies were painted with the colors of prosperity. Now it was a wasteland of rust-red dust and jagged stone, swept by toxic winds that would scour flesh from bone in moments. Had my people done this? had the great sleep of our tomb-world somehow poisoned the very planet that contained it or was this merely the natural evolution of a world over the span of millions of years such questions were academic now meaningless contemplations for a mind that retained the capacity for curiosity but lacked the biological imperative of wonder My legions emerged from the tomb world in perfect formation, rank upon rank of gleaming warriors, whose metal bodies reflected the harsh light of a dying sun. The humans had established a research outpost atop the very entrance to our domain, ignorant of the horrors that slumbered beneath their feet. Primitive structures of Plaskrete and Ferrocrete huddled against the punishing environment, life-support systems humming with desperate energy. I observed them through augmented senses, perceiving not merely visible light but the full spectrum of radiation, the heat signatures of living bodies, the electrical impulses, such of crude machinery. Humans scurried about their business, unaware of their impending doom. Scientists, soldiers, laborers, a microcosm of their empire's hierarchy, containment protocol. I commanded, and my will transmitted instantly to the Legion commanders. Secure the perimeter. No communications to leave the surface. The response was immediate. Squads of warriors teleported to strategic positions surrounding the human outpost, phase weapons at the ready. Specialized units moved to disable communication arrays and orbital beacons. The humans would be isolated, their deaths unwitnessed, their fate unknown to their kind until it was far too late. I strode forward across the blasted landscape, my bodyguard of Lichgard arrayed around me. Their tall forms moved with fluid grace despite their massive weapons and heavy armor. Ancient warriors who had once sworn blood oaths to protect my mortal form, now bound by programs and protocols to shield my mechanical shell. Did they remember their oaths? Did some fragment of their former loyalty persist in those impassive metal skulls? I could not know. Unlike me, they showed no signs of the personality glitches that preserved fragments of memory and identity. They were tools now, nothing more, while I remained cursed with the ghost of selfhood. The humans detected us when we were half a kilometer from their perimeter. Alarms sounded, shrill and panicked. Figures rushed to defensive positions. Weapons were readied. I perceived their biosigns accelerating with fear as they beheld our approaching army. The stuff of their species nightmares made manifest. A voice crackled over an external voxcaster, speaking the crude Gothic language of the Imperium. Unknown forces, halt and identify yourselves, or we will open fire. I analyzed their defenses with cold precision. Primitive las weaponry, a few heavy bolters, nothing that posed any significant threat to necrodermis. They had a single sentinel walker, an ungainly machine that seemed absurdly crude compared to the elegant death machines of my own forces. Their perimeter wall would crumble like sand before the gauss weapons of even my most basic warriors. Identify yourselves! The voice repeated, the pitch rising with barely suppressed terror. I could have ignored them, could have simply ordered the attack and watched as my legions reduced their outpost to atoms. But something in me, some remnant of the being I had once been, stirred with, not compassion, for such emotions were beyond my capacity now but perhaps curiosity. A desire to understand these creatures who now claim dominion over a galaxy that had once belonged to my kind. I am Overlord Aketsaran. I replied, my voice amplified and translated into their crude language by systems integrated into my form. You trespass on sovereign territory of the Necron Empire. Your presence has awakened this tomb world. Your lives are forfeit. There was a pause, and I imagined the confusion and fear on their organic faces as they processed my words. Then came the response, not from the perimeter wall but from a figure that emerged from the central structure of their outpost. An older male human, judging by the white hair and lined face, dressed not in the uniform of their military, but in the robes of what appeared to be a scholar. We meant no trespass, he called, his voice steadier than that of the defender. We are a scientific expedition from the imperium of man. We had no knowledge that this world belonged to. To your kind. I analyzed his words, his tone, his stance. There was fear there, certainly, but also something else. Fascination. Intellectual hunger. This human was not merely terrified. He was intrigued. Knowledge would not have altered your fate, I replied. All who disturbed the slumber of the tomb worlds must be eliminated. The human scholar took another step forward, ignoring the urgent whispers of his companions. Please, overlord, we are but a small expedition. Our destruction serves no strategic purpose. Perhaps, perhaps instead there could be an exchange of information. We have much to learn from your ancient civilization. An exchange? The concept was almost amusing in its absurdity. What could these ephemeral creatures These mayflies who lived and died in the blink of a cosmic eye possibly offer to beings who had mastered the very fabric of reality before their species had crawled from the evolutionary muck. And yet, and yet I found myself hesitating to give the order to attack. Was it mere curiosity that stayed my hand, or something deeper? Some echo of the diplomatic skills I must have possessed in my mortal life, when I had been a ruler of flesh and blood, negotiating with other nations of my own kind. You have nothing we require, I said at last. Your existence is an irritant, nothing more. Then why speak with me at all? the human asked, and I detected a subtle shift in his tone, a calculated gambit. If we are nothing, why not simply destroy us without word or warning? The fact that you address me suggests something else. Curiosity, perhaps. A desire to understand what has transpired in the galaxy during your long sleep. Impertinent creature. To presume to analyze my motivations. And yet, accurate, in its way. There was a hunger in me, not for sustenance, for my necrodermis required no fuel, but for knowledge, for context. For some understanding of how the galaxy had changed while my kind slumbered in our tombs, my Lichgard tensed at my side, sensing my hesitation, awaiting the command to obliterate this presumptuous human. The Legion commanders likewise paused in their advance, bound to my will, anticipating the order to commence the slaughter. The human must have sensed the precipice on which he stood, for he pressed his advantage. Overlord, I am Magos Explorator Delphin Routh of the Adeptus Mechanicus. I have spent my life studying the ancient technologies of the galaxy. I recognize the opportunity before me, the chance to glimpse the wonders of a civilization that predates humanity itself. Surely such knowledge is worth preserving, even temporarily. The Adeptus Mechanicus. I accessed fragmentary data from the Tomb World's archives, information gathered during brief periods of awakening throughout the millennia. The tech priests of the human imperium, devotees of what they called the machine god, collectors of technology and law, primitive cyborgs who replaced their flesh with crude machinery, a pale imitation of what my kind had achieved. Your existence is temporary regardless, Magos Routh, I replied. Whether you die now or after I have extracted whatever useful information you possess matters little in the grand calculation. Hope flickered across the human's partly mechanical face. Then you will spare us, at least for now? I will speak with you, I clarified. The fate of your expedition depends on what you can tell me of this era, of the current state of the galaxy, and of how you came to disturb my tomb world. Relief visibly washed over the human's features, though his companions seemed less assured. The armed defenders maintained their positions, weapons trained on my forces, as if their primitive firearms could penetrate necrodermis. Lower your weapons, the Magos called to his people. The overlord has granted us an audience. An interrogation, I corrected. Not an audience. I am no longer a ruler who holds court. I am a mechanism of extinction with questions that require answers." The human bowed his head slightly, acknowledging the distinction. As you wish, Overlord. Shall we speak here, or would you prefer to enter our facilities? The thought of entering their crude habitat, surrounding myself with the stink and noise of organic life-forms, was distinctly unappealing. Yet I found myself curious to observe their technology, their methods, their adaptations to this hostile world. Your central structure, I decided, clear, all personnel except yourself and two others of your choosing. Any sign of treachery, any attempt to activate hidden defenses or communications, will result in the immediate atomization of every living thing within a ten-kilometer radius. Understood. The Magos replied, then turned and began issuing orders to his people. I watched as the humans scrambled to comply, their movements hurried and fearful. Many cast terrified glances at my assembled forces, at the implacable ranks of warriors whose Gauss weapons could reduce them to their component atoms in milliseconds. I turned to my Legion commanders, transmitting orders through the command protocols. Maintain positions, full alert status, detect and neutralize any attempt at communication beyond this planet. Prepare tomb defenses for potential counter-strike. Then I addressed my lich guard. Two will accompany me. The rest will secure the perimeter of the human structure. As the warriors moved to execute my commands, I found myself considering the strangeness of this moment. For countless millennia, standard protocol upon awakening had been simple. Eliminate all intruders, secure the tomb world, return to stasis until the great awakening. Deviation was not part of the program. Curiosity was not part of the design. Yet here I stood, preparing to parley with a creature whose existence spanned less than a single flicker of cosmic time, whose civilization was built upon the ruins of countless others, ignorant of the true history of the galaxy they presume to rule. Was this evidence of my degradation? Of flaws in my programming accumulating over the vast spans of my dormancy? Or was it something else? Some ember of my former self, some fragment of the being who had ruled with wisdom as well as power, persisting despite the biotransference that should have stripped away all but the most fundamental aspects of my identity. I could not know. The self-diagnostic protocols revealed no malfunction, no corruption of my core. The Directives By all measurable standards, I was functioning within optimal parameters, yet I was choosing a course that no properly functioning Necron overlord should consider. I was curious, and in that curiosity, I recognized something dangerously close to an emotion, a ghost of my long-surrendered mortality. As I approached the human structure flanked by my lich guard, I wondered what other remnants might stir within me after this awakening. What other fragments of my former self might have survived the long sleep and the even longer nightmare of biotransference? And I wondered, with a disquiet that should have been impossible for a being of living metal, whether such remnants were a final gift of my mortal existence, or a subtle curse designed to torment me through the endless eternity of my undeath word counts so far three thousand four hundred and eighty seven the interior of the human facility was a curious blend of primitive technology and desperate adaptation Cooling systems hummed inefficiently against the planet's punishing heat, while crude atmospheric processes labored to filter toxins from the recycled air. Power cables snaked across metal floors, connecting various machines whose purpose I could discern at a glance. Geological analysis, atmospheric sampling, archaeological documentation, So they had come to study, these humans. To excavate and examine the very world beneath which my legion slumbered, their ignorance would have been amusing if it were not so pitiful. The Magos led me to a central chamber that appeared to serve as both command center and primary research hub. Screens displayed data streams, topographical maps, and what I recognized as partial scans of the upper levels of my tomb world, though their instruments had barely penetrated the outer defensive layers. Two other humans waited there as I had permitted, a nervous-looking female in the uniform of their imperial guard, presumably the expedition's military commander, and another tech priest, younger than Rolth, with fewer mechanical augmentations. Overlord Akhet Seren, the Mago said with a bow that seemed to be genuine deference rather than mere fear. May I present Colonel Helena Vornos of the Hadrian's Wall Regiment and my assistant, Lex Mechanic Thule. I acknowledge them with the briefest inclination of my head, a gesture that felt strangely familiar, as though my body remembered courtly protocols from an age when I had presided over flesh and blood courtiers. Explain your presence, I commanded, dispensing with any pretense of diplomatic niceties. Why does the Imperium of Man send its soldiers and priests to this world? The humans exchanged glances before the Magos answered, We are part of an explorator expedition mapping the southern reaches of the ghoul stars. This planet, designated Orpheus IV in Imperial Records, showed unusual energy signatures that suggested possible Archaeotech deposits. Our mission was to investigate and, if valuable technology was found, secure it for the Adeptus Mechanicus. Archaeotech, their term for the remnants of more advanced civilizations which they scavenged like vermin picking through the leavings of their bettas. I felt a flicker of something like disgust, another echo of emotions that should have been purged during biotransference. You sought technology beyond your comprehension. I stated. Now you have found its owners. Indeed, the Magos agreed, his augmatic eyes whirring as they adjusted focus. Though I confess, even with my extensive studies of Xeno civilizations, I did not expect to encounter the Necrontier, the Necrons. In such a state of preservation, the use of my species' original name caught me by surprise. Few among the young races knew that term, the designation we had borne when we still possessed flesh and souls before the great transference. You know of the Necrontier? I asked, allowing a note of curiosity to enter my synthesized voice. Fragments only, the Magos admitted. Ancient texts, comparative mythologies across multiple worlds, certain classified archives within the Mechanicus. Enough to know that your race once ruled this galaxy long before the rise of humanity, and that you possess technology that even at the height of the dark age of technology, humanity could not match. Flattery, perhaps. Or genuine reverence. With these tech priests, the line between scientific curiosity and religious awe was thin indeed. Then you know why your presence here means death, I said. The awakening protocols are absolute. No witnesses may survive to report the location of an active tomb world. The female officer, Colonel Vornos, spoke for the first time, her voice steady despite the fear evident in her elevated heart rate. With respect, overlord killing us achieves nothing, our absence will be noted. Another expedition will come searching, then another. The Imperium does not abandon its people without investigation. A logical argument, though flawed. By the time your Imperium investigates, this tomb world will have relocated, its surface presence erased. Your deaths will remain a mystery. Then why not kill us immediately? She challenged. Why this conversation at all? A question I had asked myself. The answer remained elusive, hidden in the fragmented memories and corrupted emotional subroutines that constituted what was left of my true self. Information, I said at last. I would know of this Imperium, of the state of the galaxy, of how much time has passed since my kind ruled the stars. The younger tech priest, Toul, made a sound of surprise. You don't know? Your kind doesn't maintain some form of temporal awareness during stasis. Stasis is not sleep, I explained, finding myself curiously willing to educate these doomed creatures. It is suspended animation at the quantum level, perfect preservation, but at the cost of perfect isolation. Each awakening is, in many ways, a rebirth into an unfamiliar cosmos. Fascinating, breathed the rend. Magos. A technological solution to immortality, but one that disconnects you from the very timeline you seek to endure. A poetic assessment, I acknowledged, but incomplete. Now, speak of the galaxy as it exists. How long has your imperium ruled? What other powers challenge your dominion? What year is it by your reckoning? The humans exchanged glances again, some unspoken communication passing between them. Finally, the Margos answered. By imperial reckoning, this is the year 41,287. The god-emperor has sat upon the golden throne of terror for over 10 millennia, guiding humanity through the stars. The Imperium spans much of the galaxy, though it is constantly under threat from various Xenos races and the corrupting forces of chaos. The numbers meant little to me. Imperial dating systems were based on their species' own brief history, not the vast cosmic cycles by which my kind had once measured time. But the mention of chaos resonated oddly in my consciousness, triggering fragmented data memories of ancient enemies. Elaborate on these threats, I commanded, what species now vie for dominance? Colonel Vornos answered this time, her military perspective apparently deemed more relevant. The green-skin orcs infest countless worlds, an ever-present menace that cannot be fully eradicated. The Eldari, once a mighty empire, now exist as fragmented cultures, some raiding from hidden ports in the webway, others dwelling on massive craft worlds, The Tyrannids, a relatively new threat, consume entire systems, converting all biomass to spawn more of their kind. She paused, then added with visible discomfort, and in recent centuries, the Necrons, your kind, have been awakening across the galaxy. Tomb worlds dormant for millions of years are stirring to life. Some seek only to claim their ancient territories, others seem bent on exterminating all life. So the great awakening had begun, just as the silent kings had planned before the long sleep, the Necron, dynasties rising to reclaim what was once theirs, to cleanse the galaxy of the young races that had flourished during our absence. And yet, hearing it described by this human, the grand design seemed suddenly hollow. What purpose did it serve? what victory could be claimed by beings who had surrendered joy pleasure taste touch and even the comfort of true death and how do my kind fare in these conflicts i asked genuinely curious about the successes or failures of other tomb worlds your kind are formidable the colonel admitted with professional respect Imperial forces struggle against Necron technology. Your weapons disintegrate matter at the atomic level. Your living metal repairs damage that would destroy any other material. And your numbers, reports suggest endless legions, rising from worlds thought barren or dead. Yet you still fight, I observed, knowing you face an enemy superior in every measurable way. The Emperor protects, she said simply, with the conviction of true faith. Humanity is his chosen species. We will endure, as we have endured every threat since the Great Crusade. Religious fervor. Another organic weakness my kind had long abandoned, though I remembered a time when my people had worshipped the stars themselves, before science had revealed their true nature and our own cosmic insignificance. "'Your faith is irrelevant,' I said. Facts are what I require. Tell me of these other Necron dynasties. Have you encountered lords or overlords by name? The Magos took over again, clearly eager to demonstrate his knowledge. Imperial Records document encounters with entities identifying themselves as Imotec the Stormlord, Trazine the Infinite, Anrakir the Traveler, and Nemesor Zandrek among others. Each appears to control significant forces and territory. Names I recognized from the time before the Great Sleep, so some of my peers had survived the millennia with their identities intact. I wondered if they too suffered the fragmented memories that haunted me, or if their biotransference had been more complete, leaving them free of the emotional echoes that disturbed my perfect logic. And what do you know of our history? I pressed, curious about how much these humans had pieced together about the true nature of my species transformation. We know your kind were once flesh and blood, the Magos said cautiously. That you transferred your consciousness into mechanical bodies to achieve immortality. That you once served entities known as the Seton, star gods of immense power, before turning against them in some ancient rebellion. A simplified version of the truth, but accurate in its essentials. These tech priests had done their research well, despite the fragmentary nature of the evidence available to them. The transference was not a choice. I found myself saying, the words emerging unbidden from some damaged part of my programming, it was a surrender born of desperation and deception. The Setan promised eternal life. They delivered eternal imprisonment. The humans stared at me, clearly surprised by this volunteered information. The Magos leaned forward, his augmatic eyes whirring with intensity. You, remember this? he asked carefully. The time before the transference? Your organic existence? Fragments, I admitted. Uncertain why I was sharing such vulnerability with creatures I would soon destroy. Corrupted data memories that should have been purged. Sensory echoes of experiences no longer possible in this form. But, that would mean. The Magos breathed. That some aspect of your original consciousness survived intact. Not merely a digital copy or simulation, but a continuous thread of selfhood persisting across millions of years. I detected the religious awe in his voice, the reverence of a being who had himself replaced portions of his organic form with mechanical parts, who worshipped what his kind called the machine god. To him, I represented the ultimate expression of his faith's aspirations, complete transcendence of flesh. If only he understood the truth, That transcendence without sensation was a prison. That immortality without joy or pain was a tomb far more constraining than the physical structures in which my kind had slumbered. Enough, I said abruptly, uncomfortable with the direction of the conversation. You have not yet explained how you located this specific world or why you chose to excavate here. The Colonel and the Magos exchanged another glance before the latter answered, We followed a trail of sorts. Ancient star charts recovered from a space hulk that drifted into imperial space near Kardunyash. The charts contained notations in a language our cogitators could not fully decipher, but certain symbols consistently appeared near specific star systems. This system was marked with particular prominence. Star charts, I repeated, accessing my fragmented memory banks. From what era? What was the source vessel's configuration? The Space Hulk appeared to be primarily constructed around the remnants of an ancient vessel of unknown origin. The Magos replied, pre-imperial certainly, possibly dating to the Dark Age of technology or earlier. The star charts themselves were stored in a data vault of unusual design, utilizing crystal matrix technology similar in some respects to Eldari constructs, but distinct in fundamental ways. A cold certainty settled over my mechanical thoughts. These star charts were of Necrontier origin, navigator charts from before the Great Sleep, marking the locations of major tomb worlds. You did not stumble upon this world by accident. You were led here. The three humans fell silent, their organic minds struggling to process the implications of my statement. It was the young Lex mechanic who spoke first, his voice barely above a whisper. Led here. By whom? Indeed, by whom? What faction in this divided galaxy would possess such ancient knowledge and choose to share it with humans? What purpose would be served by guiding them to a dormant tomb world? The answer came to me with the cold clarity of machine logic. You were sent to awaken us, to trigger the revival protocols and force this tomb world into activity before its scheduled time. The question is not who led you here, but who benefits from our premature awakening. The Magos's partly mechanical face showed genuine shock. That's. That would imply a level of manipulation beyond anything we. Your comprehension is irrelevant, I interrupted. You are pawns in a game whose board encompasses the galaxy and whose players predate your species' evolution. The only remaining question is whether your usefulness extends beyond the role you have already played. I turned away from the humans, transmitting a query to the Tomb World's central intelligence, The response confirmed my suspicions. This awakening was indeed premature by several thousand years, according to the original timetable established before the Great Sleep. Something, or someone, had deliberately accelerated our revival. Your expedition, I asked, turning back to the humans. How many ships brought you to this world? Just one, Colonel Vornos answered, the Mechanicus Explorer vessel paths of inquiry, currently in orbit, awaiting our scheduled communications. And when you fail to make contact, standard protocol would be to send down a heavily armed investigation team, she replied. If they too failed to report, the ship would transmit an astropathic distress call to the nearest imperial outpost, then initiate orbital bombardment of any identified threat. Primitive but logical, these humans understood the principle that denied knowledge was preferable to knowledge in the hands of enemies. Then we have limited time, I decided. Before your vessel takes action that would force a response from this tomb world's automated defenses. A response that would reveal our awakening to the galaxy at large before I determine who orchestrated this encounter and to what purpose. The Magos stepped forward cautiously. Overlord, if I may suggest, we could send a coded message to the paths of inquiry, instructing them to maintain position but take no action. This would buy time for, for whatever course you decide upon. A transparent attempt to postpone their execution, but not without merit. I needed time to fully assess the situation, to determine which of the various galactic powers might have engineered this premature awakening, and why you will compose such a message, I agreed. It will be transmitted under controlled conditions and contain only what I approve. any attempt to include hidden warnings or coded distress signals will result in immediate termination. Relief visibly washed over the humans, though they were wise enough not to express it openly. They understood that I had merely postponed their deaths, not cancelled them. There is much more I would know about the current state of the galaxy, I continued. About the disposition of the other Necron dynasties, about these tyrannids and the forces you call chaos, you will compile all relevant data for my review gladly the magos agreed with unseemly eagerness this tech priest at least seemed to value the exchange of knowledge over his own survival a trait i could almost respect were respect still within my emotional capacity I transmitted orders to my forces outside, instructing them to secure but not yet destroy the human outpost, to maintain surveillance for any approach by their orbital vessel, and to continue the awakening of the tomb world's deeper levels according to standard protocols. Then I turned back to the humans, these fragile creatures of flesh and fear who now stood at the nexus of events, spanning millions of years and unfathomable distances, Their brief lives would end soon enough. But first, they would serve as my window into the galaxy that my kind had once ruled and would rule. Again, if the great plan of the Silent Kings came to fruition, a plan I was beginning to question, as fragments of my former self, of the being who had ruled with wisdom rather than mere power, continued to resurface within the cold architecture of my mechanical mind. Word count so far, 5,522. Over the following hours, the humans proved surprisingly useful. The Mayghost directed his subordinate to compile data archives from their expedition's records, producing a remarkably comprehensive overview of the current galactic political landscape. The Colonel, meanwhile, sent the approved message to their orbiting vessel, buying us the time I required without betraying any hint of the situation on the surface. I absorbed the information with the perfect recall of a machine intellect, integrating it into my understanding of the cosmos as it now existed. The picture that emerged was one of a galaxy in perpetual conflict, torn between competing powers, each claiming dominion yet none achieving it. The human's imperium, vast but decaying, consumed by superstition and bureaucracy, the fragmented remnants of the Eldari, once masters of the galaxy, now a dying species clinging to the shreds of their former glory. The ravening tyrannid hive fleets, extragalactic predators consuming all in their path. The green-skin orcs, an eternal plague of violence spreading wherever stars shone, and the insidious forces of chaos, the great enemy that had existed since before even my kind had risen to sentience. Most significant to my immediate concerns were the reports of other awakened Necron tomb worlds. Some functioned as expected, their lords and overlords executing the grand plan with mechanical precision. Others displayed concerning deviations, dynasties pursuing independent agendas, lords forming temporary alliances with the young races, overlords exhibiting signs of severe degradation after their long dormancy, We were not the monolithic force we had once been. Millions of years of stasis had taken their toll. Some of my kind had awakened damaged beyond repair, their programming corrupted, their memories fragmented even more severely than my own. Others had apparently developed dangerous levels of independence, pursuing goals at odds with the original purpose of the Great Sleep. and then there were the truly troubling cases. Necron lords who displayed signs of genuine emotion, of desires and fears that should have been impossible for beings who had surrendered their souls during biotransference. Was this evidence of catastrophic degradation? Or of something more profound, some unexpected evolution of our kind during the eons of dormancy? As I processed this information, I moved through the human outpost, observing their primitive technology, their crude attempts to study my world. The Colonel followed at a respectful distance, ready to answer questions but wise enough not to speak unbidden. I could sense her fear, but also her disciplined control over it. A warrior worthy of respect, in her limited way. Your kind fights well, I observed, pausing before a display showing combat records from encounters between Imperial forces and Necron warriors. Despite your technological inferiority... The Imperial Guard may lack the advanced technology of other forces, she replied with evident pride. But what we lack in quality, we make up for in quantity, and in courage. Courage, I repeated, the concept feeling strangely distant yet familiar. A function of your biological fear response and your cultural indoctrination, a useful trait in organisms designed to reproduce and evolve. Less relevant to immortal beings. with respect overlord she said carefully if your kind truly felt nothing feared nothing desired nothing why awaken at all why reclaim your empire why continue to exist a penetrating question striking at the paradox at the heart of my species existence We had surrendered our souls for immortality, surrendered joy to escape, pain, surrendered growth to escape decay. And for what? To rule a galaxy we could no longer truly experience or enjoy. To continue an existence devoid of purpose beyond mere persistence. Protocol, I answered. But the word sounded hollow even to my audio receptors. The great plan established before the sleep requires it. And who established this plan? She pressed, showing unexpected boldness. Are they still among you? Do they remember why? I turned to regard her fully, my emerald gaze meeting her fragile organic eyes. You ask dangerous questions, human. Forgive me, she said, lowering her gaze. I spoke out of turn, but she had not. Her questions echoed my own unvoiced doubts, the fragments of identity that stirred within my mechanical mind like ghosts haunting empty halls, who indeed still remembered the true purpose behind the great sleep. The silent kings who had led us into biotransference had long since departed the galaxy in self-imposed exile. Those of us who remained were executors of a plan whose architects were absent, whose purpose grew increasingly obscure with each passing millennium. I moved on, turning my attention to a geological survey of the planet's surface displayed on one of their primitive data screens. The readouts confirmed what I had already observed. This world had changed dramatically since my tomb world had been established beneath its surface. Continental drift had altered coastlines. Climate shifts had transformed ecosystems. What had once been a world of remarkable biodiversity was now a toxic wasteland. Had this been the work of my own kind, some final act of planetary engineering before the great sleep, or merely the natural evolution of a world over millions of years? The records in my fragmented memory banks provided no clear answer. How many worlds has your expedition surveyed? I asked the colonel, changing the subject. Seventeen in this sector alone, she replied. Most barren or hostile to human life, though too, showed potential for eventual colonization. And how many showed signs of previous civilization? Evidence of ancient technology? She hesitated, clearly weighing how much information to volunteer. Three, including this one. The others contained ruins of indeterminate origin, though the Magos believed one site might have been Eildari in nature. Eildari. The name the humans used for those my kind had known as the Eildari. Another ancient race, though young compared to the Necrontier, who had risen to dominance during our long sleep. Their empire had spanned the galaxy once, before their own hubris had brought them low, creating the very chaos gods they now fled. History repeating itself. Species rising, flourishing, then falling to extinction or irrelevance. An endless cycle playing out across the aeons while my kind slumbered in our tombs, preserved but not truly alive, waiting for. What? To reclaim a galaxy that had moved on without us? To rule over worlds we could no longer truly experience or enjoy. I was disturbed from these unproductive contemplations by a priority data burst from the tomb world's central intelligence. The awakening protocols had progressed to the royal courts, and the lesser lords of my dynasty were now stirring from stasis. Soon they would rise and seek audience with me, their overlord, expecting orders and direction. What would I tell them? That I harbored doubts about the very purpose of our existence? That I questioned the grand design that had guided our kind for millions of years? Such weakness would not be tolerated. Such deviation from protocol would be seen as evidence of critical degradation, grounds for my replacement by a more reliable commander. your leaders i said to the colonel a new line of inquiry forming in my mechanical mind this emperor upon his golden throne he guides but does not rule directly how does such a system function she seemed surprised by the question but answered readily enough the emperors will is interpreted by the high lords of terror and the various branches of imperial government His direct guidance comes through the Astronomicon, the psychic beacon that allows warp travel, and through certain miracles and manifestations of his divine power. A figurehead. Then, I observed, a symbol around which your species rallies rather than an active ruler. That's. That would be heresy to suggest, she replied, her voice lowering. The Emperor is the master of mankind, the savior of humanity. Without his constant vigilance against the powers of chaos, our species would have been destroyed or corrupted long ago. Interesting. Their system depended on faith as much as on tangible governance. The emperor, whoever, or whatever he truly was, served as both ruler and religious icon, uniting their fragmented dominion through belief as much as through military power or political authority. My own dynasty had no such unifying principle. We had hierarchy, strict and unyielding, but nothing that inspired devotion or loyalty beyond the programmed protocols that bound lesser necrons to their superiors. And even those protocols had degraded over the millennia, as evidenced by the reports of rogue lords and breakaway dynasties. Perhaps that was why the humans fought so fiercely despite their obvious technological disadvantage. They believed in something beyond mere survival or dominance. They had purpose, however misguided or based on falsehoods it might be. What purpose drove my kind now? The silent kings were gone. The Catan were defeated, shattered into shards, imprisoned or destroyed. The Eldari Empire that had risen during our sleep had already fallen. Even our ancient enemies, the species that had driven us to the desperate gamble of biotransference, were long extinct, their very name forgotten by all save the eldest of my kind. We had outlived our enemies, outlived our purpose, outlived even our own organic identities. What remained but hollow persistence. Execution of protocols established so long ago that their original purpose was lost to corrupted memory banks and degraded programming. A priority alert interrupted these dangerous thoughts. One of my Legion commanders reported unusual energy readings from the planet's northern hemisphere. Readings consistent with a translocation event, a method of instantaneous travel similar to but distinct from the human's primitive warp technology, someone else had arrived on this world. someone using technology that matched neither human nor necron patterns, and they had arrived with purpose, materializing less than 20 kilometers from the location of my tomb world's primary entrance. Colonel, I said, turning to the human who still awaited my next question, your vessel in orbit, could it have detected other ships approaching this system? Her expression showed confusion, Possibly, though they would have reported such a development immediately. Unless they had been destroyed or otherwise prevented from sending such a report. I transmitted orders to my forces, directing scout units to investigate the translocation site while placing the rest of my legions on highest alert status. Magos Routh, I called, my voice carrying through the crude communication system of the human outpost. Attend me immediately. The tech priest appeared within moments, his partly mechanical body moving with the jerky eagerness of a supplicant approaching a deity. Yes, Overlord? How may I serve, your knowledge of Xeno's species, I said. Describe the translocation technologies used by the Eldari. His augmatic eyes word in what I interpreted as surprise at the specific question. The Aildari primarily utilize what is called the webway, a network of tunnels through a dimension adjacent to both real space and the warp. It allows near-instantaneous travel between fixed points without the dangers associated with true warp transit. Their portal technology is among the most advanced known to the Imperium, capable of moving armies without the need for spacecraft. And the energy signatures associated with such translocations, I pressed. How would they appear to scanning technology? The Margos hesitated, clearly struggling to understand the purpose behind my questions. Webway gates produce distinctive energy patterns, characterized by intense but highly focused dimensional distortion often accompanied by static discharge and temporary gravitational anomalies, consistent with the readings my scouts had detected. So, Aildari had arrived on this world, precisely as my tomb world awakened. Another coincidence? I thought not. The pieces were beginning to arrange themselves into a pattern, though the full picture remained elusive. Your expedition, I said, has it encountered Aildari forces in this sector previously? No direct contact, the Magos replied. Though we detected signs of possible Eildari observation during our survey of the Lothairus system two months ago, sensor ghosts, energy readings that appeared and disappeared too quickly to lock onto. Being watched, then. The humans had been under surveillance by the Eildari, perhaps from the moment they had acquired the star charts that led them to this world. Porns indeed, but whose game were they playing in? The Aildari were known for their elaborate schemes, their willingness to manipulate lesser races to achieve goals, centuries or millennia in the making. But what could they hope to gain from the awakening of a Necron tomb world? The answer came to me with cold clarity. Distraction, diversion of resources. The humans would respond to the threat of an awakened tomb world with military force, drawing attention and forces away from. What? What else was occurring in this sector that the Eldari wished to conceal or protect? I needed more information. The fragmented data in my memory banks was insufficient, and the human's knowledge was limited by their brief lifespans and parochial concerns. A new thought formed in my mechanical mind, one that would have been unthinkable before the flaws in my programming had begun to manifest. What if, instead of simply eliminating these humans as protocol demanded, I used them, used their vessel, their communication channels, their access to imperial networks to gather the information I required. It would be a significant deviation from established protocols, a risk. But the situation was already far from standard. My tomb world had been awakened prematurely, possibly as part of an Aildari scheme. The galaxy had changed dramatically during our long sleep. Adaptation might be necessary for survival, let alone victory. Colonel Vornos, I said, decision made. You will send a new message to your vessel. You will instruct them to conduct long-range scans of this entire sector, focusing particularly on anomalous energy readings and signs of Aildari activity. You will emphasize that this is a priority override superseding all previous mission parameters. Her expression showed confusion and weariness. They'll question such an order without explanation. And our scanning capabilities are limited. You will inform them that you have made first contact with a previously unknown xeniform species willing to share information of critical importance to imperial security," I continued. You will not mention Necrons specifically. You will request that they maintain communication silence except for encrypted transmissions on channels you will specify. I paused, watching her process these instructions. seeing the calculations behind her organic eyes as she weighed obedience against deception, survival against duty. And if I refuse? she asked quietly. Then you and your expedition die immediately, your vessel is destroyed by this tomb world's defenses, and I proceed with alternative methods to obtain the information I require. I modulated my voice to what my system identified as a more conciliatory tone. cooperate and your people may yet survive this encounter resist and their deaths are certain she nodded slowly professional pragmatism overcoming whatever reservations she harbored i understand i'll draft the message for your approval margos wrath i continued turning to the tech priest You will compile all available data on Eldari activity in this sector over the past standard century. Focus particularly on patterns of movement, worlds they have shown interest in, and any instances of conflict or cooperation with imperial forces. At once, overlord, he replied, his tone suggesting barely contained excitement at the opportunity to collaborate with a being of my nature." These tech priests, with their worship of technology and their own partly mechanical nature, viewed my kind with a disturbing blend of fear and reverence. As the humans moved to execute my commands, I transmitted orders to my tomb world's central intelligence, directing it to accelerate the awakening of specific units. Death marks, the specialized assassins of the Necron forces, ideal for reconnaissance and targeted elimination, cryptex of the chronomantic discipline, whose technology could detect and analyze temporal anomalies that might reveal aildari manipulation, and most importantly, the Praetorians, my personal guard from the time before the Great Sleep, whose loyalty protocols were engraved at the quantum level of their programming. I would need them all if my suspicions proved correct. If the Eldari were indeed manipulating events in this sector, using the humans to trigger my tomb world's awakening as part of some larger scheme, Then this was merely the opening move in a game whose board encompassed not merely planets but entire systems, whose pieces included armies and fleets, and whose stakes might well determine the future of the galaxy itself. A game I found myself unexpectedly eager to play, as more fragments of my former self, of the being who had been a master strategist and diplomat, as well as a warrior, continued to resurface within my mechanical consciousness. Perhaps there was purpose after all in this hollow immortality, not the mindless execution of ancient protocols, but the application of intelligence and will to new challenges, new enemies, new possibilities. For the first time since awakening, I felt something almost like anticipation stirring within the cold circuits of what had once been my soul. Word count so far, 7601. The humans proved more adaptable than I had anticipated. Within hours, Colonel Vornos had established the communication protocols I required with their orbiting vessel, while the Magos and his assistant compiled an impressively comprehensive analysis of Eldari activity in the sector. Their efforts suggested not merely fear-driven obedience, but a genuine eagerness to demonstrate their usefulness, perhaps hoping to postpone their inevitable termination. Meanwhile, my tomb world continued its awakening sequence. The great crypts of the Warrior Legions were now fully activated, rank upon rank of immortal soldiers rising from stasis, their vacant eyes igniting with emerald fire as power flowed once more through their necrodermis frames. The lesser lords and nobles of my court had begun to emerge as well, their more complex programming requiring longer initialization periods. i would need to address them soon they would expect guidance orders a reaffirmation of the great plan established before the long sleep what would i tell them that i harbored doubts about the very purpose of our awakening that i questioned the protocols that had guided our kind for millions of years Such honesty would be interpreted as malfunction, as critical degradation requiring immediate correction. No, I would need to maintain the appearance of proper function while pursuing my independent investigation of the Eldari presence on this world. I was contemplating this dilemma when the first report from my reconnaissance units arrived. They had reached the site of the translocation event in the Northern Hemisphere and found clear evidence of Eldari presence. energy residue consistent with a temporary webway gate, footprints indicating a small but well-equipped force, and most significantly, an encrypted data shrine positioned to monitor my tomb world's primary entrance. So they were watching, observing the awakening with purpose and careful planning. But to what end? I instructed my forces to maintain surveillance but not to engage. If the Eldari detected my awareness of their presence, they might alter their plans, depriving me of the opportunity to discern their true intentions. A priority alert from the Tomb World's central intelligence interrupted these tactical considerations. One of the noble crypts had completed its activation sequence, and its occupant was now proceeding toward the overlord's chamber, seeking audience. The identity signature identified him as Nefermart, Lord of the Southern Marches, once my most trusted lieutenant in the time before the Great Sleep. I recalled fragments of our shared history, campaigns against rival dynasties, diplomatic missions to other Necrontier domains, even glimpses of friendship from the distant era before biotransference. Would he too retain such fragments, or would he be as most of our kind had become, a perfect machine intelligence unmarred by emotional echoes or memory glitches? I returned to the heart of my tomb world to receive him, leaving the humans under heavy guard with strict instructions to continue their assigned tasks. The Colonel had seemed relieved at my departure, though the Margos had appeared almost disappointed, as if he valued the opportunity to interact with a being of my nature, despite the mortal danger I represented. The overlord's chamber was a vast hall of living metal and glowing power conduits, designed to impress and intimidate in the manner of the royal courts from before biotransference. Massive pillars inscribed with the history of my dynasty rose to a ceiling lost in shadows, while the floor was inlaid with the dynastic glyph in luminescent crystal. My throne, a towering construction of necrodermis and phase crystal dominated the far wall positioned so that any who approached would feel the weight of my authority with every step i took my place upon it an action that felt strangely ritualistic as if i were playing a role rather than simply assuming my rightful position the protocols of rulership of dominance and submission seemed suddenly artificial constructs of a civilization that had died millions of years ago yet whose forms we still mindlessly preserved nephermat entered with the precise measured movements of a high-ranking necron lord His form was ornate by our standards. His necrodermis adorned with glyphs of office and symbols of past victories. The staff he carried hummed with contained energy, both weapon and badge of rank. His face, like mine, was an expressionless metal mask, the empty eyes glowing with the same emerald fire that animated all our kind. Overlord Akhet Sarin, he intoned, his voice the same synthetic approximation as my own, I rise from stasis to serve, as in ages past. Lord Nefamart, I acknowledged. The tomb world awakens ahead of schedule. External forces have triggered our revival protocols. He processed this information with machine efficiency. A breach of the great plan. Countermeasures are required. Indeed, I agreed. Though the situation is complex, the intruders who triggered our awakening appear to have been manipulated by another force. Aildari presence has been detected on the surface. The path is clear, Nefremat stated without hesitation. Eliminate all intruders, secure the tomb world, return to stasis until the appointed time." Standard protocol, executed without question or consideration of altered circumstances. This was what most of my kind had become, perfect machine intelligences, efficient and deadly, but lacking the adaptability, the creativity that had once been our species' greatest strength. The galaxy has changed during our slumber, I said carefully. New species have risen to dominance. Old enemies have fallen. The great plan may require adaptation. Nephomart's glowing eyes fixed on me with sudden intensity. Adaptation? The protocols established by the Silent Kings are absolute. Deviation suggests critical degradation. A pause, brief but significant. Has your programming been corrupted, Overlord? And there it was, the implied threat, the embedded hierarchy of our kind. If an overlord showed signs of malfunction, it was the duty of the royal court to correct the situation, by replacement if necessary. Millions of years of perfect stasis had not erased the politics of power that had defined Necrontier civilization since its earliest days. My systems function within optimal parameters, I stated, a technical truth if not a complete one. But tactical flexibility has always been the hallmark of successful command. The Eldari are observing our awakening with purpose. I would know that purpose before committing our forces to action." Nefermaut processed this explanation, his mechanical mind weighing protocol against pragmatism. A delay in standard response patterns. Unusual, but not without precedent. What course do you propose, Overlord? Relief flowed through my circuits, an emotional echo that should have been impossible. Controlled awakening of specialized units only, surveillance of the Eldari observers, interrogation of the human intruders who triggered our revival. Once we understand the full tactical situation, we can determine the appropriate response. The humans still live? Nefermat's tone contained what might have been surprise, or perhaps disapproval. Protocol dictates immediate termination of all intruders. They possess information, I explained. Knowledge of the current galactic political landscape, of other awakened, tomb worlds, of Aildari activity in this sector. Information we require for optimal decision-making. Again, that measuring gaze, that calculation of whether my behavior fell within acceptable parameters or indicated dangerous degradation. I will inspect these humans, he decided. Assess their information value personally. A reasonable request from a loyal lieutenant, or the first step in building a case for my replacement. With Nefamat, as with most of our kind, emotion and intention were unreadable behind the expressionless metal mask and emotionless synthesized voice. Of course, I agreed, seeing no reason to refuse that wouldn't itself appear suspicious. They are contained within their research outpost on the surface. I will accompany you. We proceeded through the vast corridors of the tomb world, past chambers where more of our kind were awakening, past arsenals where weapons of unimaginable destructive potential hummed with contained energy ready for deployment. Warrior units stepped aside as we passed, their programming recognizing our rank and authority without conscious thought. As we walked, I provided Nefremat with a summary of what I had learned from the humans, the state of the galaxy, the position of the major powers, the status of other awakened tomb worlds. He absorbed this information in silence, offering neither comment nor question, his thoughts concealed behind the perfect machine logic that governed our kind. We reached the surface access point, a massive gateway of living metal that reconfigured itself as we approached, opening to reveal the harsh daylight of the world above. The toxic atmosphere swirled with dust devils, minor energy discharges crackling through the ionized air. Neither bothered us. Our necrodermist bodies required no breath and were impervious to such environmental hazards. The human outpost was visible in the distance, now surrounded by a perimeter of Necron warriors standing in perfect immobility. Their gauze, weapons ready but inactive, The primitive structures looked fragile and temporary against the backdrop of the blasted landscape, as ephemeral as the lives of the creatures who had built them. Primitive construction, Nefremat observed, inefficient design. These creatures ruled the galaxy in our absence. One portion of it, I corrected. They compete with other species for dominance. Their advantage lies in numbers and adaptability rather than technological superiority. Biological traits, he noted with what might have been disdain, had emotion been possible for our kind. Irrelevant to true power, I found myself wanting to disagree, to argue that the very traits we had surrendered creativity, intuition, emotional intelligence were perhaps more valuable than we had recognized, but such a statement would only reinforce any suspicions Nefermatt might harbor about my proper functioning. I led him toward the central research facility where the humans awaited. The warriors at the perimeter parted silently at our approach, their programming recognizing the command protocols emanating from our forms. We found the humans engaged in their assigned tasks, the Colonel communicating with their orbiting vessel, the Magos and his assistant compiling data on a primitive cogitator array. They looked up as we entered, their organic faces showing the expected fear response at the sight of two Necron lords, though the Magos's expression contained that same disturbing blend of terror and reverence I had noted before. Colonel Vornos, Magos Routh, I said by way of introduction. This is Lord Nefamart of my royal court. The humans acknowledged the introduction with cautious nods, the Colonel's hand straying unconsciously toward the sidearm she no longer possessed, the Magos making a curious gesture that appeared to be a religious sign of his cult. These are the intruders," Nefermatt inquired, his emerald gaze sweeping over them with mechanical assessment. Their physical parameters indicate extreme fragility. Their technology is primitive by comparison to our own. Yet you claim they possess valuable information? Information transcends the medium of its storage, I replied. These humans have traveled widely through this sector. They have studied records of other encounters with our kind. They have observed Aildari activity that may relate to our premature awakening. Nephemat approached the Margos, who stood his ground despite visible trembling. The Necron Lord towered over the human, his ornate form designed to intimidate, to reinforce the absolute hierarchy that defined our species. You, Nephemat addressed the Margos directly. Your designation is Raoth. You possess knowledge of Eildari movements in this sector. The Magos glanced at me, perhaps seeking permission or reassurance, then straightened his partly mechanical form as much as his hunched physiology allowed. Yes, my lord. I have compiled all available data from imperial records regarding Eildari sightings, engagements, and suspected activities within a fifty light-year radius of this system, covering the past 100 standard years. Show me, Nefremat commanded. The Magos moved to his cogitator array, activating a display that projected a three-dimensional map of the sector. Points of light indicated star systems, with color coding to denote imperial presence, contested zones, and unexplored regions. symbols marked confirmed and suspected aildari activity, forming a pattern that even to my eyes seemed non-random, suggesting purpose rather than mere opportunistic raiding. The aildari presence has been concentrated along this spiral pattern, the Magos explained, tracing a path through the holographic display. Initially, Imperial analysts believed they were simply following traditional raiding routes, targeting vulnerable colonies and shipping lanes. But closer examination revealed they were consistently avoiding certain systems with high strategic, or value while showing disproportionate interest in seemingly worthless worlds. Such as this one, Nefamart observed. Precisely, the Magos agreed, his professional enthusiasm momentarily overcoming his fear. Orpheus IV has no valuable resources by imperial standards, no strategic position worth defending, no population to tithe or convert. Yet, we detected signs of Eldari observation during our approach to the system, and now you confirm their presence on the surface. They led you here," Nefremat stated. Reaching the same conclusion I had, used you to trigger our awakening. So it would appear, the Magos acknowledged, though to what purpose remains unclear. The Eldari are known for their convoluted strategies, their willingness to sacrifice pawns for objectives that may not become apparent for decades or centuries. Nefemar turned to me, his emotionless face nevertheless somehow conveying intensity. This confirms your assessment, Ovalord. Our awakening has been precipitated by external manipulation. The question of purpose remains. There is more, Colonel Vornos interjected, her military training evidently overcoming her caution. The long-range scans from our vessel have detected unusual activity in the Lothairus system. Energy signatures, consistent with major Aildari forces in transit, far larger than typical raiding parties. This was new information, not previously shared, I fixed my gaze on her, noting the subtle signs of stress in her organic form, elevated heart rate, perspiration, pupillary dilation. You withheld this data. It only came through moments before you returned, she explained quickly. The transmission is still being decoded. But preliminary analysis suggests significant Aildari military assets converging on a specific location within the Lathyrus system. What is in the Lothiris system, Nefremart demanded. The Margos manipulated his cogitator, bringing up a new display showing a solar system with three planets orbiting a red dwarf star. Nothing of apparent value, a dead world closest to the star, a gas giant, and an ice world on the outer edge. No imperial presence, no resources worth extracting. No strategic value, no value by human standards, I corrected. But perhaps great value by Aeldari measures, or, or by Necron measures, Nephemat finished my thought. The pattern becomes clear overlord. The Aeldari seek something in the Lotharis system, something they do not wish us to find or reclaim. They arranged our premature awakening as a diversion, expecting us to follow standard protocols, eliminate the human intruders, secure our tomb world, then return to stasis. While they secure whatever lies in the Lathyrus system unopposed, I agreed. Manipulating multiple species to achieve their goal without direct confrontation. An elegant strategy, worthy of respect. Respect is irrelevant, Nefremat stated. Appropriate countermeasures are required. We must deploy forces to the Lothairus system immediately. I considered this proposal. It aligned with my own tactical assessment but carried significant risks. Deploying major forces would reveal our full awakening to the galaxy at large. It would commit us to a course of action based on limited information. And it would leave our tomb world with reduced defenses, should the Aildari manipulation prove more complex than it appeared. A measured response. I decided. A reconnaissance force only, utilizing our most advanced stealth technologies. We must confirm what the Eldari seek before committing to full engagement. Nefamat's glowing eyes fixed on me, measuring, assessing. Caution where aggression is indicated. Unusual. Overlord. Prudence. I corrected. Not caution. We have slumbered for millions of years. A delay of hours or days to ensure optimal deployment is logical. Again that calculating gaze, that assessment of whether my behavior indicated proper function or dangerous degradation. Then, a slight inclination of his head. Your command strategies were always more subtle than most overlord. I defer to your judgment in this matter. Relief flowed through my circuits again. Nefamat accepted my authority, at least for now. but his suspicion remained, a potential threat should my behavior continue to deviate from expected patterns. Prepare a night-sithe with deathmark complement, I ordered. Full stealth protocols. Reconnaissance only. No engagement unless discovery is imminent. Priority objective. Identify the Eldari target in the Lothairus system. It shall be done. Nephemat acknowledged, then turned his gaze back to the humans. And these creatures. Their usefulness appears limited now that we have extracted their information. The implied suggestion was clear, eliminate them as protocol demanded. Their continued existence served no practical purpose and represented a potential security risk. By all logical measures, their termination was the correct course of action. And yet I found myself reluctant to give the order. not from any sentimental attachment to these fragile beings, but from a growing conviction that rigid adherence to protocol to the patterns established before the great sleep, was itself becoming a limitation rather than a strength. They retain value as interpreters of current galactic politics, I said, formulating a justification that would satisfy Necron logic, and as potential communication channels with their Imperium should tactical necessity require it. Nefremat considered this explanation. Unorthodox, but not without merit. I will oversee the reconnaissance deployment to Lothairus. You will continue extraction of useful data from these creatures. With that, he turned and departed, his movements precise and purposeful, a perfect machine executing its function without hesitation or doubt. The humans visibly relaxed once he had gone. The tension in their organic bodies easing. The Colonel gave me a curious look, perhaps recognizing that I had, in effect, spared their lives against the clear preference of my subordinate. Your colleague seemed eager to terminate our arrangement, she observed carefully. Adherence to protocol is the foundation of our hierarchy, I explained, finding myself strangely willing to educate these doomed creatures about my kind. Deviation suggests malfunction. Malfunction requires correction, and our continued survival represents deviation, she concluded with impressive insight. Why take the risk, overlord? What do you truly hope to gain from us now? a penetrating question that struck at the heart of my own uncertainty. What did I hope to gain? Information. They had already provided all they possessed of obvious value. Strategic advantage. Their primitive technology and limited resources offered none against the forces arrayed in this emerging conflict. Perhaps, I realized with something like disquiet, what I sought was not tactical advantage but understanding. Not merely data about the current state of the galaxy, but insight into how living beings perceived and navigated it. The perspective of creatures who still experienced the full spectrum of existence, who felt fear and hope, who could still taste and touch and dream. Insight, I answered simply, into a galaxy that has changed profoundly during our long sleep, into species that now compete for dominance where once we ruled unchallenged. The Magos stepped forward, his augmatic eyes whirring with intensity. You seek to understand us? As we seek to understand you, understanding improves prediction, I said, falling back on the cold logic of strategy. Prediction improves response. Response determines victory or defeat. It was true as far as it went, but incomplete. the full truth was more complex more disturbing i sought something that should have been impossible for my kind connection meaning beyond mere persistence purpose beyond protocol these dangerous thoughts were interrupted by a priority alert from the tomb world's central intelligence The Night Scythe was prepared for launch, crewed by Deathmarks and piloted by a specialist cryptec of the Chronomantic discipline. Nefer Marta waited only my final authorization to deploy, I transmitted the command code, approving the mission. Within moments, the sleek craft would emerge from the tomb world's hidden hangars and accelerate into the void, its phase technology rendering it virtually undetectable to conventional senses. It would reach the Lothairus system within hours, observe the Aeldari operations there, and return with data that might clarify the true nature of their interest in that seemingly worthless collection of dead worlds. Your vessel will continue long-range scans of the Lathyrus system, I instructed the colonel. Transmit all data immediately, no matter how insignificant it may seem, she nodded, apparently accepting her role in this unfolding drama. And if your colleague returns with different instructions regarding our status... A valid concern. Nefemart's acceptance of my decision to spare the humans had been reluctant at best. Given the opportunity, he might well choose to eliminate them regardless of my orders, seeing it as correction of an overlord's evident malfunction. You will remain under my direct protection, I assured her, though the promise felt strange, almost foreign to my nature. Protection of lesser species was not part of Necron Protocol. Yet another deviation that would raise questions about my proper functioning. As I contemplated this disturbing trend in my behavior, a new alert reached me from the reconnaissance units monitoring the Aildari presence on the planet's northern hemisphere. The observers had suddenly withdrawn, their monitoring equipment deactivated, their temporary webway gate closing behind them. They were retreating. Why? What had changed to prompt this sudden withdrawal? The answer came with cold clarity. They had achieved their objective. Our forces were deploying to the Lothiris system, away from the tomb world. Whatever distraction they had sought to create, it had succeeded. Which meant their true target might not be in the Lothiris system at all. A deception? I transmitted to Nefermaut, who was overseeing the Night Scythes launch. The Eldari withdraw from the planet, Lothiris may be a secondary diversion. His response came immediately. Tactical reassessment required. Shall I abort the reconnaissance mission? I considered our options. If Lothiris was indeed a diversion, sending forces there played into the Eldari strategy. But if it was not, if something of vital importance to both our kinds truly lay hidden in that system, failing to investigate could be a critical error. Proceed with the mission, I decided, but with heightened alert status at the tomb world. Deploy perimeter defenses to maximum radius, activate all sensor arrays and detection systems. If the Eldari intend action against this tomb world itself, they will find us prepared. As the orders transmitted, I found myself experiencing something that should have been impossible for my kind. Anticipation tinged with concern. Emotional echoes from my long-surrendered organic existence, persisting despite the biotransference that should have eliminated all such weaknesses. Yet in this moment, these emotional fragments did not feel like weaknesses, they felt like resources. Different ways of processing information and predicting outcomes. The cold logic of machine intelligence combined with the intuitive leaps of organic thought, Perhaps this was why I had been preserved as overlord when so many of my peers had been reduced to mindless automatons or limited strategic engines. Perhaps some fragment of the being I had once been, of the leader who had guided his people through the stars, had been deemed worth preserving, even at the cost of perfect mechanical efficiency. As I returned my attention to the humans, to these fragile creatures whose lives hung by the thread of my continued protection, I wondered what other fragments of my former self might yet stir to consciousness as this unexpected awakening continued to unfold. And I wondered whether those fragments would prove to be assets or liabilities in the complex game that was now in motion. a game whose board encompassed worlds and whose pieces included entire species each moving according to their own nature and their own perception of victory word count so far nine thousand six hundred and ninety The Night Scythe departed for the Lothiris system, its advanced phase technology, rendering it virtually invisible to conventional detection methods. Meanwhile, I expanded the defensive perimeter around the tomb world, deploying additional warrior phalanxes and activating dormant defense systems that had lain idle for millions of years. Something about the Eldari withdrawal troubled me. It suggested not merely the success of their diversion but a completion of objectives. As if their observation of our awakening had provided all the information they required, and now they moved to the next phase of whatever complex strategy they were executing. I returned to the human outpost, where Colonel Vornos and the Magos continued their assigned tasks. The Colonel was coordinating with their vessel in orbit, directing long-range scans of not only the Lothiris system, but the surrounding space as well. The Magos had expanded his data compilation to include analysis of Necron activity throughout the galaxy, based on Imperial encounter reports. Your kind does not act as a unified force, the Magos observed as I entered, apparently having overcome enough of his fear to initiate conversation. Different tomb worlds pursue different agendas, sometimes in direct conflict with each other. Is this normal, expected? An insightful question that cut to the heart of a troubling reality. No, I answered truthfully. The great plan established before the sleep envisioned coordinated awakening, unified purpose. The fragmentation was not anticipated. Entropy affects all systems over time, he said, a statement that seemed part scientific observation, part religious dogma given his cult's beliefs. Even the most perfect machine degrades when subjected to sufficient temporal pressure. Millions of years of dormancy, billions of quantum-level processes suspended in stasis, then reactivated. Was it any wonder that degradation had occurred? That tomb worlds awakened with altered protocols, that overlords and lords pursued independent agendas, that the grand design had fractured into competing subroutines? You speak of degradation, I noted. Yet you yourself voluntarily replace organic components with mechanical ones. Your Adeptus Mechanicus seeks to transcend biology through technology. The Magos made a curious gesture, touching metal fingers to his partly organic chest in what appeared to be a religious sign. We seek the blessing of the Omnisiah, the machine God. The perfect union of organic consciousness with mechanical perfection. Not the replacement of one with the other, but the elevation of both to a higher state of being. And you believe such union is possible, I asked. Genuinely curious about this strange faith that seemed to echo, in its way, the ancient ambitions of my own kind. That consciousness can be preserved while the organic substrate that generates it is replaced. His augmatic eyes focused on me with unexpected intensity. You are the living proof of it, overlord." You speak, you reason, you strategize. Your consciousness survived the transition from organic form to mechanical vessel, did it not? A profound question that struck at the heart of my existence. Had my consciousness truly survived biotransferrence intact, was I truly the same being who had once ruled as a creature of flesh and blood, now merely housed in a different form, Or was I merely a perfect simulation, a machine intelligence programmed with the memories and behavioral patterns of that long-dead organic being? I had no answer that would satisfy either of us. The fragments of memory that stirred within my mechanical mind felt authentic, felt like a continuous thread of selfhood persisting across the vast gulf of time and transformation. But was that itself merely an illusion, a program designed to maintain the hierarchy of Necrons society by preserving the fiction that the Lords and Overlords remained the same beings they had been before biotransference? Your insight is... unusual for a species of your evolutionary development. I said, avoiding the deeper philosophical question. Few among the young races grasp the true nature of consciousness. The Magos seem to accept this deflection, perhaps recognizing the boundaries of our strange discourse. The Adeptus Mechanicus has studied consciousness for millennia, overlord. It is the greatest mystery of existence, the boundary between mere mechanism and true intelligence. A boundary my kind had crossed long ago, though perhaps not in the direction the Magos imagined. From true, organic intelligence to something else. Something that preserved the appearance of consciousness but had surrendered the essence that gave it meaning. Colonel Vornos interrupted these philosophical musings with news of a more immediate nature. Overlord, our vessel reports unusual readings from the edge of the system, energy signatures matching neither imperial nor standard Zeno's patterns. The cogitators are still analyzing, but preliminary assessment suggests... She hesitated, as if uncertain how to proceed. Continue, I commanded. Preliminary assessment suggests Necron technology, she finished. Different in configuration from your forces, but similar in fundamental energy patterns. Another Necron presence in this system? impossible by standard protocol. Each star system containing a tomb world was assigned to a specific dynasty, a specific overlord. multiple necron forces operating independently in the same system indicated severe protocol violation or deliberate intrusion transmit the exact coordinates and sensor readings i ordered the colonel complied directing her vessel to send the data to the communication systems i had established within their outpost The readings appeared on their primitive display screens, confirming her report. Necron energy signatures, but with oscillation patterns that differed subtly from those of my dynasty. Another Tomb World's forces, operating covertly at the edge of my territory, I transmitted an urgent query to Nephomat, now overseeing the Tomb World's defenses in my absence. His response was immediate. Our long-range sensors had detected nothing. Either the intruding Necron forces possessed stealth technology superior to our detection capabilities, or they had positioned themselves precisely to avoid our sensor grid. Either possibility suggested sophisticated planning and advanced capability. Not a random intrusion, but a calculated operation with specific objectives. Expand the scan radius, I instructed the Colonel, full-spectrum analysis. Identify the intruder's vector and activity patterns. As she relayed these instructions to their vessel, I processed the tactical implications of this development. Another Necrron dynasty operating in my territory, coinciding with Aildari manipulation that had triggered my tomb world's premature awakening. The connection seemed obvious, yet the purpose remained elusive. Were the Eldari and these unknown Necrons working in concert? Unlikely, the ancient enmity between our kinds ran too deep for such cooperation. More probably, they were engaged in parallel operations with separate objectives, perhaps exploiting the same vulnerability or seeking the same prize. But what prize? What could exist in this unremarkable system that would draw the attention of both the Eldari, with their ancient knowledge and prophetic farcite, and another Necron dynasty, with their perfect machine logic and eons old plans? The answer came to me with sudden clarity. A Catan Shard. The star gods who had betrayed us had been shattered after the biotransference, their godlike power fragmented into shards that were then imprisoned in Tesseract labyrinths or specialized containment devices. But some shards had been lost during the chaos of rebellion, cast adrift in space, or hidden on worlds that would later be forgotten during the Great Sleep. If such a shard had been discovered in this system, it would explain both the Eldari interest and the intrusion by another Necron dynasty. The Eldari would seek to ensure the shard remained imprisoned, fearful of the devastation a freed Satan could wreak upon the galaxy. The rival Necrons would seek to capture it, to harness its power, or ensure it remained under proper containment. Colonel. I said, my synthetic voice betraying none of the urgency I now felt. Direct your vessel to scan specifically for exotic particle emissions in the TerraVolt range, particularly around the system's star and outer planets. She looked puzzled but relayed the instructions. The Magos, however, showed immediate understanding, his augmatic eyes widening with what appeared to be both fear and excitement. You suspect a Satan shard. he breathed the words barely audible even to my enhanced audio receptors a fragment of one of the star gods themselves i neither confirmed nor denied his conclusion the presence of a katan shard was information too dangerous to share openly even with creatures as harmless as these humans If word reached the wrong factions within their imperium, it could trigger a gold rush of sorts, with various powers seeking to claim the shard for themselves, ignorant of the true danger it represented. Speculation is premature, I stated. Further data is required. The colonel's communication with their vessel continued for several minutes, the exchange of information slowed by the primitive encryption systems they employed. Finally, she turned to me with new information. The unknown necron force appears to be conducting a systematic sweep of the system's outer reaches, she reported. Their pattern suggests they're searching for something specific, and yes, our sensors detect unusual energy readings from the third planet, the ice world at the system's edge. The precise nature of the emissions matches none of our known templates, but they are extremely powerful and appear to be fluctuating in a regular pattern. The ice world of course, a perfect natural prison for a Catan shard. The constant cold would slow its energy emissions, making it harder to detect. The isolation would minimize the risk of accidental discovery by primitive species, and the hostile environment would discourage exploration by all but the most determined seekers. This changed everything. If a Khitan shard was indeed present in this system, its containment and security took absolute priority over all other considerations. The protocols for such situations were clear and inviolable. Secure the shard at any cost, prevent its acquisition by rival dynasties, and above all, ensure it did not escape confinement. I transmitted emergency orders to Nephomart, prepare our fastest and most heavily armed vessels for immediate deployment to the system's outer reaches. Recall the night scythe from Lothirus that had indeed been a diversion, as I had suspected, and accelerate the awakening of our doomsday arcs, the most powerful weapons platforms in my dynasty's arsenal. His acknowledgement came with an appended query. The humans? Their vessel has observed both the rival Necrons and the anomalous readings. They represent a security risk. He was right, of course. By all logical measures, the humans and their vessel should be eliminated immediately. They possessed information that could lead others to the Citan Shard. They had the means to transmit that information to their Imperium. Their continued existence violated every protocol established for situations involving carton shards, and yet their vessel provides our only current observation of the rival Necron force, I replied. Maintain surveillance. Elimination can be executed at any time. Information once lost cannot be recovered. A weak justification, and I knew Nefarmat would recognize it as such. But it bought time-time. I needed to fully assess the situation and determine the optimal course of action. The Margos watched me with those whirring augmatic eyes, his partly mechanical face nevertheless expressing a depth of understanding that should have been impossible for a creature of such limited lifespan and experience. You're protecting us, he said quietly, against your own protocols, against the wishes of your subordinates. Why Overlord? What value do we truly hold for a being of your nature? Again, that penetrating insight, cutting to the heart of the contradiction in my behavior, what value indeed did these fragile creatures hold? Their technology was primitive, their lifespans insignificant, their knowledge limited by both their brief existence and the superstition that governed their society. And yet I found myself unwilling to exterminate them as protocol demanded. Was it merely tactical pragmatism, as I claimed to Nefema? Or something else, some fragment of the being I had once been, some echo of values and principles long thought surrendered during biotransference. Your continued utility is calculated on factors beyond your comprehension, I said, the cold machine answer that protocol demanded. But even as the words emerged from my vocalizer, I recognized their falsity. The truth was more complex, more disturbing. I was changing, or perhaps remembering. The damaged fragments of my original consciousness were reassembling themselves, forming a more complete picture of the being I had once been. Not merely the strategic genius who had led his dynasty to victory in countless campaigns, but the leader who had valued wisdom over mere power, who had understood that true dominance came not from destruction, but from comprehension. The biotransference had been meant to strip us of such weaknesses, to transform us into perfect machine intelligences unburdened by empathy or moral constraint, but it had not entirely succeeded, at least not with me. Something had survived, some core of identity that transcended the physical form that housed it, and that something was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the mindless execution of protocols established millions of years ago by entities whose wisdom I now found reason to question. Prepare for transition, I instructed the humans. You will accompany me to my command vessel. Your expertise regarding the current galactic political landscape may prove useful in the coming engagement. Another deviation from protocol, another decision that Nefremat and the other lords would view as evidence of malfunction, but one that felt increasingly right, increasingly aligned with the being I was remembering myself to be. As the humans gathered their essential equipment and data stores, I transmitted orders for the preparation of my personal command ship, a massive crescent-shaped vessel that had slumbered alongside its master for countless millennia. It would take time to fully activate its systems, to crew it with the appropriate specialist units, to bring its weapons and defenses to optimal functionality. Time during which the rival Necron force, already active and searching, might locate the Satan Shard. Time during which the Eldari, with their mastery of the Webway, might return with reinforcements to secure or destroy the Shard themselves. Time during which Nefremat and the other lords might conclude that their overlords' increasingly erratic behavior represented a threat to the dynasty's proper functioning and take steps to correct the situation. The game had grown more complex, the board expanded to include not merely this system but potentially the fate of the galaxy itself. Should a Citan Shard fall into the wrong hands or, worse, escape confinement entirely? And I found myself playing not merely against external enemies, but against the very protocols that had governed my existence since biotransference. The cold machine logic insisted that protocol must be followed, that deviations indicated malfunction, that the proper course was the one established before the great sleep. But the fragments of my original consciousness, the echoes of the being I had once been, whispered that adaptation was strength, that rigid adherence to ancient directives in a changed galaxy was itself a form of malfunction. As I led the humans toward the Tomb World's vessel bays, I found myself wondering which voice would prove correct in the complex game now unfolding. The perfect machine logic of the Necron Protocols, or the flawed but flexible wisdom of the consciousness that had somehow survived the biotransferrence, damaged but not destroyed. And I wondered, with a disquiet that should have been impossible for a being of living metal, what price victory might demand, regardless of which path I chose to follow. Word count so far, 11,779. My command vessel, the Eternal Dominion, awakened to my presence with the silent efficiency that characterized all Necron technology. Ancient systems activated, power flowing through conduits untouched for millions of years, weapons arrays charging to readiness, dimensional engines warming for translation into real space. The great crescent-shaped craft had slumbered alongside its master throughout the long ages of the tomb world's dormancy, preserved in perfect stasis, untouched by time or decay. I escorted the humans aboard, noting their reactions to the vessel's interior. The Magos's face showed naked awe, his augmatic eyes whirring frantically as he attempted to comprehend technologies beyond his civilization's understanding. Colonel Vornos maintained a more disciplined composure, though her elevated heart rate and perspiration betrayed her unease at being surrounded by the cold geometric precision of Necron architecture. you will remain in these chambers during transit i informed them directing them to a section i had designated for their use environmental adjustments have been made to accommodate your biological requirements attempt to access any other portion of this vessel and termination will be automatic the Colonel nodded her understanding. The Margos seemed barely to hear me, his attention fixed on the living metal of the chamber walls, the way they shifted subtly in response to the vessel's awakening systems. Remarkable, he breathed. The material appears to possess a form of limited consciousness, responding to external stimuli without direct command pathways. A true machine spirit, beyond anything the Mechanicus has achieved. Necrodermis, I confirmed. Living metal, the fundamental substrate of all Necron technology. It responds to certain command protocols and repair imperatives autonomously, while more complex functions require directed control. And it forms your bodies as well, he observed. The same material that constructs your vessels and weapons houses your consciousness. The universal substrate, I acknowledged. one of the katan's few gifts that was not tainted by deception. I had not intended to reference the katan, but the words emerged unbidden, another symptom of the fragmented memories and emotional echoes that continued to surface within my mechanical mind. The Margos seized upon this slip immediately, his curiosity overriding his caution. The katan deceived your kind, he asked. The biotransference was not what you expected. a dangerous topic, one that protocol strictly forbade discussing with lesser species. The true nature of biotransference, the horror of what had been done to us, the betrayal by the very entities we had worshipped as gods. These were secrets kept even from most of our own kind, locked away in the memory banks of overlords and lords, preserved as warning but never spoken aloud. and yet I found myself answering, the words emerging from some damaged part of my programming that retained not merely memory but bitterness. They promised immortality without loss, eternal life in bodies impervious to disease, to age, to pain. They did not mention the cost. The loss of sensation, the Magos surmised his partly mechanical face showing surprising compassion, of emotion, of the very experiences that make consciousness meaningful. More than that, I continued, unable to halt this dangerous disclosure. The loss of true reproduction, of evolution, of the capacity to grow and change. We became a species frozen in time, preserved but not truly alive, existing but not living. The Colonel, who had been silent during this exchange, spoke with unexpected insight. You regret the choice. Not a question but a statement, delivered with the calm certainty of one who had witnessed regret before, who understood its weight and implications. Regret is an emotion, I replied automatically, the standard Necron response to any suggestion of emotional capacity. Emotional responses were eliminated during biotransference. With respect, Overlord, she said, her tone suggesting she knew she was venturing onto dangerous Your actions suggest otherwise. You've deviated from what you yourself described as standard protocol multiple times. You've spared our lives when logic dictated our elimination. You've shown curiosity about our perspectives, our experiences. These are not the behaviors of an emotionless machine. Dangerous observations indeed, all the more so for their accuracy. If Nefermat or the other lords heard such assessments and reached similar conclusions, they would see it as confirmation of critical degradation, of malfunction requiring immediate correction. Tactical, flexibility appears as emotional response to species of limited cognitive capacity. I stated, falling back on the cold machine logic that had governed my kind for millions of years. your interpretation is based on projection of your own emotional frameworks onto behaviors you do not fully comprehend the colonel accepted this rebuke with a slight nod though her expression suggested skepticism rather than conviction the magos meanwhile continued to examine the chamber with barely contained excitement His attention shifting from the walls to the geometric patterns inscribed on the floor, to the glowing energy conduits visible through translucent panels in the ceiling. Your vessel will communicate its status regularly, I continued, changing the subject to more practical matters. It has been permitted to maintain orbit but is under constant surveillance. Any attempt to break orbit or transmit to other imperial forces will result in its immediate destruction. Understood. The the colonel replied though i should note that if we fail to make our scheduled report to sector command they will dispatch investigation forces as per standard protocol by which time we will have concluded our business in this system and departed i assured her your imperium's bureaucracy moves with all the speed of continental drift by the time they mobilize a response force this entire region of space will be empty of both necron and aildari presence A priority alert from the tomb world interrupted our conversation. Nefamart reported that the vessel preparations were complete, with two additional craft readied to accompany the Eternal Dominion, a doom-scyth squadron for reconnaissance and close support, and a night shroud for long-range scanning and detection of cloaked or phase-shifted targets. Your presence is requested for final command authorization, Overlord, Nefamart's message concluded." The formal phrasing could not disguise the implicit criticism that I had been spending time with the humans rather than overseeing the mission preparations personally as protocol demanded. Remain here, I instructed the humans. Environmental systems will maintain appropriate life support conditions. Sustainance units have been provided according to the biological requirements detailed in your expedition's medical databases. With that, I departed. moving through the corridors of the Eternal Dominion toward the primary teleportation chamber that would return me temporarily to the tomb world. As I walked, I reviewed the tactical situation, forcing my thoughts into the ordered patterns of machine logic, suppressing the disruptive emotional echoes that had been surfacing with increasing frequency. The facts were clear. Aktan Shard, one of the most dangerous and valuable artifacts in the galaxy, lay hidden on the ice world at the edge of this system. A rival Necron dynasty had detected its presence and dispatched forces to secure it. The Eldari had also identified the Shard and had manipulated events to delay our response, giving themselves time to mobilize appropriate resources. Standard protocol for such a situation was equally clear. Deploy maximum available forces, secure the shard at any cost, eliminate all witnesses and competing forces, return the shard to proper containment within a tesseract labyrinth. Yet I found myself questioning this approach, not its logic, which was impeccable, but its underlying assumptions. The The protocols had been established immediately after the rebellion against the Khartan, when our kind still functioned as a unified empire. They presumed coordination between dynasties, adherence to the grand plan laid out by the silent kings before their departure from the galaxy. But as the humans' data had confirmed, and my own observations supported, that unity no longer existed, The Necron dynasties had awakened, damaged, fragmented, pursuing independent agendas, sometimes in direct conflict with each other. The grand plan lay in ruins, its architects long departed, its executors degraded by millions of years of dormancy. In such a changed context, blind adherence to ancient protocols might not represent optimal function but its opposite, a failure to adapt to new circumstances, a dangerous rigidity in the face of evolving threats. I reached the teleportation chamber and activated its systems with a thought, my command protocols interfacing directly with the vessel's technology. In a flash of emerald light, I was transported back to the tomb world, materializing in the primary command center where nephermat awaited my arrival overlord he acknowledged his emotionless metal face nevertheless somehow conveying disapproval the vessels are prepared warriors immortals and specialist units have been assigned according to standard deployment patterns we await only your command to proceed i reviewed the deployment data the assignment of forces the strategic and tactical plans all followed protocol precisely all reflected the cold machine logic that had guided our kind since biotransference The humans? Nefremart inquired, the question heavy with implied criticism. They accompany you aboard the Eternal Dominion rather than being terminated as protocol demands. They possess information about the rival dynasty that may prove tactically valuable. I explained, the same justification I had offered before, though it felt increasingly hollow even to my own audio receptors. Their elimination can be executed at any time, Their knowledge, once lost, cannot be recovered. Nephomart's glowing eyes fixed on me with uncomfortable intensity. Multiple deviations from protocol, overlord. First the delay in eliminating the intruders, then the decision to interrogate rather than terminate. Now transport aboard our command vessel, exposure to technologies no lesser species should witness. These decisions suggest significant degradation of core programming. The accusation was direct, now, not merely implied. The dangerous conclusion I had feared was being spoken aloud, the assessment that could lead to my replacement, to the end of the strange journey of rediscovery I had been experiencing since awakening. Tactical flexibility is not degradation, I countered. The galaxy has changed during our slumber. The grand plan lies in ruins. The silent kings are gone. The dynasties are fragmented. Adaptation is required for optimal function in this altered context. Adaptation within protocol parameters, Nefremart insisted. Not wholesale deviation from established directives. The biotransference eliminated such dangerous flexibility overlord. It purged the emotional weaknesses that led to irrational decisions. Your behavior suggests those weaknesses are resurfacing. He was right, of course. By every measure established since the biotransference, my behavior indicated critical malfunction. The emotional echoes, the fragmented memories, the questioning of protocols, all were symptoms of degradation by Necron standards. But what if those standards themselves were flawed? What if the biotransference, in eliminating emotion and individuality, had also eliminated the very qualities that had made our species great to begin with? the creativity, the adaptability, the capacity to evolve and grow that had elevated the Necronteer from primitive planet-bound creatures to masters of the galaxy. Your concerns are noted, I said, unwilling to engage in a debate that could only end in conflict. But the command authority remains mine. The mission will proceed as I have directed." the humans will accompany us aboard the eternal dominion. Their knowledge of current galactic politics and the behaviors of the younger races may prove valuable in anticipating the actions of both the rival dynasty and the Eldari forces." Nefremat made no further objection, but his silence itself communicated disapproval. I had asserted my authority as overlord, and protocol demanded, in his obedience. But I had also confirmed his suspicions of my degradation, strengthened his case for eventual correction. The night-sithe we dispatched to Lothairus has reported back, he said, changing the subject to immediate tactical concerns. As you suspected, the Eldari presence there was minimal, a small force only, obviously intended as a diversion, They withdrew as soon as our vessel was detected, using what appeared to be a portable webway gate. Confirming our assessment that their true objective lies within this system, I noted. Specifically, the ice world and whatever it contains. Neffermart's emotionless face betrayed nothing, but his next words carried weight. You believe it houses a Satan shard. Not a question but a statement. Nefarmat had reached the same conclusion I had, the logical deduction based on the energy readings, the interest of multiple factions, and the historical records of shards lost during the chaos following the rebellion against the Satan. The evidence supports that conclusion, I acknowledged, which means this mission takes absolute priority. All other considerations are secondary. including protocol deviations? He pressed, returning to his central concern. The securing of a Katan shard supersedes all other directives, I reminded him, citing one of the few exceptions built into Necron protocols. By any means necessary, using any resources available, including the knowledge and perspective of lesser species, if tactically relevant. A technical victory only, using the letter of one protocol to justify violation of others, but sufficient for the moment. Nefermatt could not openly challenge my authority without evidence of critical malfunction, and the Setan Shard protocol gave me latitude that normal operations would not. The final command authorization is required, he said, accepting defeat for now. The warriors await your word to march. I transmitted the command codes, the quantum encrypted signals that would activate the warrior legions assigned to this mission, awakening them from their dormant state and directing them to their assigned positions aboard the waiting vessels. Thousands of necrodermis bodies stirring to artificial life, their emerald eyes igniting as power flowed through their ancient frames. An army of the dead marching at my command. soulless automata executing the will of a being who was himself little more than an echo of true life a ghost in a machine a consciousness preserved but fundamentally altered by the biotransference that had granted immortality at the cost of everything that made immortality worth possessing As the legions marched toward the waiting ships, as the final preparations for departure were completed, I found myself experiencing something that should have been impossible for a being of living metal. Doubt. Not merely tactical uncertainty, which could be resolved through logical analysis of available data, but something deeper, more fundamental. doubt about the very nature of my existence, about the purpose that had driven my kind since the biotransference, about the future that awaited us in a galaxy that had moved on during our long sleep. The protocols provided no guidance for such doubt. They presumed certainty, purpose, clarity of objective. They had been designed for beings who had surrendered questions of meaning, along with their organic bodies, who existed simply to exist, to persist through the ages until the final victory over death itself. But what victory was persistence without purpose? What triumph was immortality without meaning? These questions, once the province of organic philosophers with their brief lives and desperate search for significance, now echoed in the quantum networks of my mechanical mind, disrupting the perfect logic of the machine with the messy uncertainties of the consciousness it housed. As I returned to the Eternal Dominion, as the great vessel's engines powered up for departure, as the Warrior legions took their assigned positions throughout its vast interior, I found myself facing not merely an external enemy in the form of the rival Necrron Dynasty and the manipulative Aildari, but an internal conflict between the machine I had become and the being I had once been, between protocol and adaptation, between existence and life. And I wondered, with a disquiet that should have been impossible for a being of living metal, which would prove stronger in the conflict to come. Word count so far, 13,889, the eternal dominion rose from the tomb world's hidden docking bays, massive doors of living metal sliding open to reveal the harsh daylight of the surface world. The great crescent-shaped vessel ascended in perfect silence, inertialist drive systems negating the effects of gravity and acceleration, weapon arrays scanning for threats, sensor grids mapping the surrounding space in exquisite detail. I stood in the command nucleus, the central chamber from which the vessel's operations were directed. Unlike the crude bridges of human spacecraft, with their primitive manual controls and dependence on verbal commands, the The Necron Command nucleus functioned through direct interface with the overlord's consciousness, the vessel responding to my thoughts as if it were an extension of my own necrodermis body. Nephemat and the other lords assigned to the mission stood in their designated positions around the periphery of the chamber, each connected to specific systems according to their expertise and authority. None spoke or moved, verbal communication was unnecessary, and physical movement inefficient when all command functions could be executed through direct neural interface. Through the vessel's sensors, I perceived the world below receding as we ascended toward orbit. The human outpost appeared tiny and fragile, a collection of primitive structures huddled against the harsh environment of a planet that had once been a paradise but was now a toxic wasteland. Their vessel, the Mechanicus Explorer Paths of Inquiry, maintained its position in high orbit, its crude technologies rendering it transparent to my enhanced perception. I checked on the humans I had brought aboard. They remained in the chambers assigned to them. the Colonel communicating with their vessel via the limited channels I had permitted, the Magos continuing to examine the living metal of the walls with fascinated reverence. Their life signs registered as stable, their behavior compliant with the restrictions I had imposed. The Night Shroud and Doom Scythe Squadron accompanied us, taking up flanking positions as we left the atmosphere and entered the void of space. The formation was standard for a Necron battlegroup, optimized for both offense and defense, with overlapping fields of fire and sensor coverage. Our destination was the ice world at the system's edge, a journey that would take mere hours with our advanced propulsion systems. In the interim, I directed the Night Shroud to extend its specialized detection grid to maximum range, seeking the rival Necron force that the human's vessel had identified. The results came almost immediately. Necron Energy signatures approximately three astronomical units from our position, moving in a search pattern around the ice world's outer moons. The configuration was consistent with a mid-sized reconnaissance force, likely the vanguard of a larger armada still en route to the system. I analyzed the energy patterns in detail, comparing them to the archives stored within the tomb world's memory banks. The results confirmed my suspicions. This was a force belonging to the Artoon dynasty, ancient rivals of my own Sekhemtar dynasty from the time before the Great Sleep. Our domains had bordered each other then. Our forces clashing in countless minor conflicts over territory and resources, though never escalating to full-scale war due to the greater threats that faced the Necrontia Empire as a whole. that the Atoon dynasty had survived the great sleep intact enough to field such a force was surprising but not unprecedented. Other dynasties had awakened before us, their tomb worlds stirring to life decades or even centuries earlier, giving them time to re-establish their power and begin reclaiming their ancient territories. What was unprecedented was their intrusion into Sekhemtar space. By the protocols established before the Great Sleep, each dynasty's territories were to be respected upon awakening, with the focus placed on reclaiming worlds lost to the younger races, rather than reigniting ancient rivalries between Necron factions. But as the humans' data had confirmed, such protocols were increasingly ignored as tomb worlds awakened, damaged, as overlords pursued independent agendas, as the Grand Plan fractured into competing subroutines. I shared this analysis with Nefarmat and the other lords through the command network, their responses registering as data bursts of acknowledgement and tactical assessment. None questioned the identification of our rivals, or the decision to intercept them before they could secure the Setan Shard. Whatever doubts they harbored about my leadership, the threat of a Setan Shard falling into the hands of a rival dynasty overrode all other concerns. We have detected the enemy force. I transmitted to the humans via the communication system established in their chambers. The Artoon dynasty, rivals of our Sekhemtar dynasty since before the Great Sleep. Their presence confirms the significance of whatever lies hidden on the ice world. The colonel's response came promptly. Do you anticipate direct conflict? It is inevitable, I confirmed. The protocols regarding Chetan shards allow for no compromise or negotiation. Whichever dynasty secures the shard claims absolute rights to it. And if the Eldari are also pursuing this, Shard, she asked. A three-way conflict? The Eldari would seek to destroy the shard rather than capture it, I explained. finding myself once again in the strange position of educating these doomed humans about matters no lesser species should comprehend. They fear the Setan above all other entities, knowing the devastation even a fragment of one could unleash if freed from containment. The Margos joined the conversation, his voice vibrating with poorly suppressed excitement. The Catan. the star gods of ancient legend, beings of pure energy who existed since the birth of the galaxy itself. To think that a fragment of such an entity lies within our reach. Your reach extends only as far as I permit, human, I reminded him coldly. The Shard, if it exists, will be secured by Necron forces and placed in proper containment. Neither your Imperium nor any other faction will be allowed to claim it. "'Of course, overlord,' he replied, chastened, but not entirely subdued. I merely expressed academic interest. The Adeptus Mechanicus has long studied references to the Catan in ancient texts and artifacts. The opportunity to observe even indirect evidence of their existence would be of immense scholarly value. I chose not to respond to this transparent attempt to secure permission to witness the coming engagement.' The human's continued survival was already a significant deviation from protocol. Allowing them to observe operations involving a Cetan shard would be an inexcusable breach of security. A priority alert from the Night Shroud interrupted this exchange. Its advanced sensors had detected a new energy signature emerging from the ice world's northern polar region. Not Necron in origin, nor consistent with any known Eldari technology, but something else entirely. Something ancient and immensely powerful, its energy patterns fluctuating in ways that defied standard analysis. The Kantan shard was stirring, responding to the approach of Necron forces, perhaps sensing the proximity of the very beings who had once worshipped it as a god, then betrayed and shattered it into fragments of its former glory. I transmitted orders to increase our speed, to intercept the Atun dynasty force before they could reach the signature's source. Time was now critical. If the shard fully awakened, if it managed to break whatever containment had held it for millions of years, the consequences would be catastrophic not merely for this system but potentially for the galaxy at large. The eternal dominion accelerated, its inertialist drive pushing it to velocities that would have destroyed lesser vessels. The Night Shroud and Doom Scythe Squadron matched our pace, the formation maintaining perfect alignment despite the extreme speeds involved. Through the vessel's enhanced sensors, I observed the ice world growing larger as we approached. A barren sphere of frozen methane and water ice, its surface carved by vast canyons and ridges, its polar regions marked by strange geometric patterns visible even from orbit. Patterns that were not natural formations but artificial constructs, their purpose and origin unknown. The Atun dynasty force came into visual range. a collection of vessels similar in design to our own, but bearing the distinctive insignia of their lineage. The solar disk symbol that had been their emblem since before biotransference, when they had been among the most devout worshippers of the carton. Their formation was standard for an advanced reconnaissance group. A central command vessel flanked by smaller craft in a defensive perimeter, sensors extended to maximum range, weapons charged but not yet targeting our approach. They had detected us, certainly, but had not yet committed to hostilities. Protocol demanded immediate engagement. The presence of a rival dynasty in Sekhemtar territory, particularly in proximity to a sit-and-shard, constituted sufficient justification for attack without warning or communication. The cold machine logic of Necron warfare recognized no need for declarations or ultimatums, and yet I found myself hesitating to give the order to fire. Not from fear or uncertainty, emotions purged during biotransference, but from a tactical assessment that seemed to emerge from the fragmented memories of my original consciousness rather than the perfect machine logic of my current form. The Artoon dynasty had been rivals, but not enemies. competitors but not existential threats. In the final days before the Great Sleep, as our species faced extinction from the war in heaven, old rivalries had been set aside in favor of species-wide cooperation. Dynastic conflicts had been suspended by order of the Silent Kings, with the promise that territories would be respected upon awakening. What if this intrusion was not hostile in intent? What if the Atun dynasty sought the Khitan shard not for power or advantage, but from a sense of responsibility, of obligation to ensure it remained properly contained? What if communication, rather than immediate violence, offered the optimal path to resolution? Such considerations were foreign to Necron Protocol. They reflected an organic approach to conflict resolution, a willingness to explore alternatives to violence that had been purged during biotransference. They were, by every measure established since our transformation, evidence of critical degradation in my core programming. And yet they felt right in a way that cold machine logic did not. They resonated with the fragments of memory and identity that continued to resurface within my mechanical mind, With the being I was remembering myself to have been before the biotransferrence stripped away everything but the capacity for perfect, emotionless calculation. Overlord, Nefermart's transmission carried urgency unusual for our kind. The enemy is in range. Weapons are locked. Awaiting your command to fire. The other lords in the command nucleus were watching me. Their emotionless faces nevertheless somehow conveying confusion at my hesitation. By all established protocols, the order to attack should have been given the moment the kududation. Enemy force was positively identified. My delay was inexplicable by Necron standards, further evidence of the degradation they already suspected. I made my decision, one that would likely confirm their worst fears about my proper functioning. Establish communication with the Artoon vessel. Priority Overlord Channel. Encrypted Quantum Protocol. Shock registered through the command network, the other lords confusion transmitting as data spikes of disbelief. Nephomad's response came laden with barely suppressed alarm. Communication, with a rival dynasty in violation of territorial protocols. This is unprecedented Overlord. The securing of the Citan Shard takes priority over all other considerations. I reminded him, using the same exception I had cited earlier to justify my deviation from standard protocols. If communication facilitates that objective with minimal resource expenditure, it represents optimal tactical approach. a weak justification, and I knew Nefremat and the others recognized it as such, but they could not openly challenge my authority without evidence of critical degradation requiring immediate correction. And so they complied, establishing the communication channel as directed. The response from the Artoon vessel came swiftly, a quantum-encrypted signal on the overlord priority frequency. The protocol identifiers confirmed what I had suspected. Their command vessel carried Overlord Amenhotep, master of the Artoon dynasty's southern territories, and, if my fragmented memories were accurate, once a diplomatic envoy to the Sekimtar court before the biotransference. Over Lord Akhet Sarin, Amenhotep's transmission carried the same synthesized voice that all our kind shared, devoid of intonation or emotion. Your awakening was not anticipated in the current phase of operations. Clarify your presence and intentions. A careful greeting, neither hostile nor friendly, acknowledging my authority while asserting his own right to operate in this system. Not the communication of a being intent on immediate hostility, but of one surprised by an unexpected complication. Overlord Amonhotep. I responded in kind. You intrude upon Sekhemtar territory in violation of pre-sleep territorial agreements. Your presence in proximity to a Class Omega anomaly requires explanation. Class Omega anomaly, the code designation for a carton shard, established during the rebellion to prevent the entities themselves from recognizing references to their kind in Necron communications. A clear signal that I knew what lay hidden on the ice world, and that I claimed jurisdiction over it by right of territorial sovereignty. The anomaly was identified by Atun long-range sensors 47 cycles ago, Amanhotep replied. Its containment status registered as deteriorating. Intervention was deemed necessary before catastrophic failure occurred. The territorial violation was an unfortunate necessity given the potential consequences of containment breach. A reasonable explanation, and one that aligned with my own speculation about their motives. Not a grab for power or an intentional provocation, but a response to a genuine threat. The containment of a Caten Shard, particularly one that had been imprisoned for millions of years in a natural rather than purpose-built facility, could indeed deteriorate over time. and the consequences of a fully awakened and uncontained Katan Shard would be devastating beyond calculation. Verification of containment status is required, I transmitted. Combined assessment teams equal representation from both dynasties. Full weapons standoff maintained during investigation. A proposal without precedent in Necron Protocol which demanded immediate seizure of the Shard and elimination of all competing forces. but one that acknowledged the shared threat the shard represented, the common interest both dynasties had in ensuring it remained properly contained. Amenhotep's response took longer this time, suggesting, consultation with his own command staff, perhaps debate about the unorthodox proposal. Finally, his transmission returned. Proposal accepted with conditions, assessment teams limited to three specialists each, Command vessels to maintain minimum safe distance from anomaly site. Dead Man Protocols to be established, ensuring destruction of the anomaly should either dynasty attempt seizure without mutual agreement. Dead Man Protocols. Another relic from the rebellion against the Seton. A system of interlocked failsafe's designed to ensure that no single faction could claim a Star God's power without consensus from the species as a whole. They had fallen into disuse during the Great Sleep, as the Necron Empire fractured into independent dynasties, each pursuing its own agenda. That Amenhotep would suggest their reactivation indicated a level of concern about the Shard that matched my own, a recognition that some threats transcended dynastic rivalries and required cooperation for the good of the species as a whole. Conditions accepted, I transmitted, Coordinates for neutral assessment zone to follow. Specialist team will deploy via phase shifter to minimize energy signatures that might disturb the anomaly. Nefarmat's private transmission to me carried unmistakable alarm despite the emotionless medium. Overlord. This deviation from protocol is without precedent. Cooperation with rival dynasties in matters involving Satan's shards is explicitly prohibited by the directives established before the Great Sleep. This decision suggests critical degradation requiring immediate correction, He was right, of course. By every measure established since biotransference, my behavior indicated serious malfunction. The proper response to a rival dynasty in proximity to a carton shard was immediate attack, the elimination of all competing forces, the securing of the shard under the exclusive control of the dynasty whose territory contained it. And yet the decision felt right in a way that protocol did not. It resonated with the fragments of memory and identity that continued to resurface, with the being I had once been before biotransference stripped away everything but the capacity for perfect, emotionless calculation. The directives established before the Great Sleep presumed coordinated awakening and unified purpose, I replied to Nefarmat. Neither condition exists in the current galactic context. Adaptation is required for optimal function in changed circumstances. The primary objective remains constant. Secure the shard and prevent catastrophic containment failure. The method of achievement must evolve to address current realities. Logical argumentation, but built on a foundation that rejected the fundamental principle of Necron existence since biotransference. That protocol was absolute. That deviation indicated degradation. That adaptation itself was a dangerous remnant of our organic past that had been purged during our transformation. I was challenging not merely a tactical directive, but the entire philosophical underpinning of what our species had become. And in doing so, I was confirming Nefremat's suspicions about my proper functioning, providing him with evidence that might justify corrective action should this mission conclude without my termination by external forces. but the decision was made the agreement with amanhotep established the specialist team was already being assembled a cryptic of the chronomantic discipline to analyze the temporal aspects of the containment a death mark with enhanced sensor capabilities to monitor the surrounding space for aildari presence or other threats and a praetorian from my personal guard whose loyalty protocols were engraved at the quantum level of his programming, ensuring compliance with my directives regardless of how unorthodox they might appear to others. As the preparations continued, I checked once more on the humans aboard. They remained in their assigned chambers, monitoring the situation through the limited data feeds I had permitted them access to. the colonel was communicating with their vessel in orbit maintaining the pretense of routine operations to prevent alarm from spreading to their imperium the magos was still examining the living metal of the walls his augmatic eyes whirring with barely contained excitement at the opportunity to observe necron technology from within Their continued survival represented yet another deviation from protocol, another decision that the other lords viewed as evidence of my degradation. And yet I found myself unwilling to order their termination, even now when their utility as sources of information had been largely exhausted. Was this mercy? An emotion that should have been impossible for a being who had surrendered organic existence millions of years ago, or merely tactical pragmatism, the recognition that living subjects of observation might yet provide insights that cold data analysis could not. I did not know. The boundary between the machine I had become and the being I had once been grew increasingly blurred, as more fragments of memory and identity resurfaced, as more emotional echoes disrupted the perfect logic of my mechanical mind. All I knew with certainty was that something profound was changing within me, something that would either elevate me beyond what I had been since biotransference or destroy me entirely, and that the outcome of that change would be determined, at least in part, by the events about to unfold on the frozen surface of a world that held one of the most dangerous entities in the galaxy.

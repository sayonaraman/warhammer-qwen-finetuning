For seventy years I wrote the approved histories, the sanitized glory of our transhuman saviors, but what I discovered beneath layers of ancient data will shatter the very foundation of imperial faith. The emperor designed them with a fatal flaw, one that has condemned humanity to an eternity of warfare from which we can never escape. Ask yourself this question. What happens when our greatest protectors are the very reason we will never know peace? The truth hides in the oldest archives, waiting for those foolish enough to seek it. I remember the day my quest began with perfect clarity, the smell of ancient parchment and machine oil, the soft hum of cogitator banks that had run without pause for millennia, the weight of the inquisitorial seal in my hand, granting me access to sections of the Mechanicus archives no mere historian should ever see. I was Remis Holt, chief archivist of the Tiberius Historical Foundation, 73 years of loyal imperial service behind me. My hands shook as I presented my credentials to the crimson-robed tech priest. Not from fear, but from the anticipation of fulfilling my life's work. The definitive chronicle of the Adeptus Astartes, commissioned by the High Lords themselves, the Emperor protects, the tech priest intoned, his augmented voice flat and emotionless. Four mechadendrites extended from his back, each scanning different sections of my documentation simultaneously. The Emperor protects, I echoed. The words felt hollow in my mouth, a ritual without meaning after so many repetitions across the decades. Yet I believed them still. I believed in his divine guidance, in his plan for humanity. I believed the Space Marines were his greatest gift to us. I was a fool. The tech priest studied me with eyes that had been replaced with gleaming red lenses. your authorization grants you access to beta-level archives in the Astartes Biological Index. Nothing beyond. That will be sufficient, I replied. My voice steady despite the excitement coursing through my veins. For fifty years I had written the approved histories, the sanitized accounts of glorious conquests and heroic last stands. Tales of space marine valor designed to inspire faith in the populace. I had been a creator of myths, a weaver of necessary fictions. But now, in the twilight of my career, the High Lords wanted something different. A truthful account, they said. A comprehensive history of the Astartes to be sealed away in the most secure vaults on terror. A record for posterity should the worst come to pass. Why they chose me, I cannot say with certainty. Perhaps because I had proven my loyalty. perhaps because as an old man i would soon take whatever secrets i uncovered to my grave the data vaults stretched before me row upon row of humming storage units containing the accumulated knowledge of ten thousand years somewhere in this labyrinth of information lay the answers i sought the true origin of the space marines the unaltered accounts of their creation at the Emperor's hand, I could not have known then what horrors those answers would contain. I could not have known that each step forward would be a step away from the comforting embrace of faith, that in seeking the truth of humanity's greatest defenders, I would discover the architects of our eternal damnation. May the God-Emperor forgive me for what I am about to record. The first night in the archives yielded little. ancient tactical deployments, supply requisitions, genetic modification protocols. Nothing I had not seen before in less restricted documents. But on the second day, as fatigue began to dull my senses, I discovered a discrepancy in the cataloging system, a subtle irregularity in the naming convention of certain files, references to documents that should have been included in the main database, but were not. I traced the anomaly through 17 different data repositories until I found it. A hidden subdirectory, accessible only through a Kunde, terminal that had not been updated to the current security protocols. Within it lay a treasure trove of information dating back to the dawn of the Great Crusade. Unredacted reports on the earliest space marine deployments, assessments of their effectiveness, and most valuable of all, correspondence between the Emperor and his inner circle regarding the purpose of the Adeptus Astartes program. My hands trembled as I opened the first file, a treatise written by the Emperor himself. The words on the screen seem to burn themselves into my mind. The Astartes are not meant to be the salvation of humanity, but its transformation. Through them we shall redefine the very meaning of human potential. They are the first step on a path that will elevate our species beyond its current limitations. A path that requires sacrifice. The Space Marines will win us the galaxy, but the cost will be our humanity. This is a price I am willing to pay. I read those words again and again, trying to reconcile them with the imperial creed I had followed all my life. The Emperor had not created the Space Marines merely to defend humanity or to reconquer the stars. He had designed them as the first stage of a species-wide metamorphosis. A stepping stone towards some transhuman future that would leave mankind as we know it behind. The implications were staggering, heretical even. But I could not stop reading. Further documents revealed the extent of the experimentation that preceded the successful Astartes template. Thousands of test subjects, most of whom died in agony as their bodies rejected the modifications, gene seed compatibility was rare, the success rate abysmal. Yet the Emperor pushed forward, driven by a vision of the future that accepted such losses as necessary. But it was a clinical evaluation from the late Great Crusade era that truly shook my faith. A comprehensive analysis of Astartes' psychology compared to baseline humans. The document was not concerned with their enhanced strength, resilience, or longevity. Instead, it focused on what had been lost in the transformation. Subject group demonstrates significant reduction in emotional range and creative thinking. Empathy levels reduced by 78% compared to baseline. Abstract reasoning capabilities intact but primarily directed toward tactical applications. Capacity for artistic expression virtually non-existent. These modifications are not side effects but intentional features of the design. The perfect warrior cannot be burdened with the full spectrum of human emotion. I closed the file and sat in silence for a long time, surrounded by the soft hum of ancient machines. What I had read contradicted everything I had been taught about the Adeptus Astartes. They were not merely humans enhanced to fight humanity's wars. They were a different species altogether, engineered to lack the very qualities that defined humanity. Compassion, mercy. the capacity for peace. And in that moment, I began to understand the terrible truth. The Space Marines had not been created to save humanity. They had been created to replace it. And in surviving the Horus heresy, in becoming the icons of a religion the Emperor never wanted, they had locked our species into an eternal cycle of warfare from which we could never escape. I should have stopped there, should have written the sanitized history the High Lords expected and retired to a life of comfortable obscurity. But the questions burned within me now, demanding answers. Why had the Emperor's grand design failed? What had gone wrong? And most troubling of all, what did it mean for the Imperium that its greatest heroes were engineered to be incapable of creating the very peace they supposedly fought for? The archives beckoned, promising answers I was no longer certain I wished to find. The deeper I delved into the restricted archives, the more I uncovered about the fundamental nature of the Astartes. Not merely their creation, but the deliberate, psychological architecture that defined them. The Space Marines were designed with a singular purpose that extended far beyond the battlefield. They were created to redefine humanity's relationship with violence itself. One document, authored by a geneticist identified only as Amar, detailed the philosophical underpinnings of the Astartes psychology. The greatest barrier to human advancement has always been our instinctive aversion to violence. Even the most hardened warrior experiences trauma, regret, and psychological damage from prolonged combat. The Astartes design eliminates these limitations. They do not suffer from combat stress. They do not question the necessity of bloodshed. They find purpose and clarity in war that no unmodified human could sustain without breaking. I found myself staring at those words, reading them repeatedly as their implications settled into my consciousness like a slow acting poison. The Space Marines were not merely superior warriors because of their physical enhancements. Their true advantage lay in their psychological makeup. they were the first humans engineered to thrive in perpetual warfare, to need it, to find meaning only through combat. Another document, a psychological assessment of early Astarte's companies, confirmed my growing suspicion. In periods of extended peace, subjects demonstrate increased aggression, paranoia, and dissatisfaction. Without the outlet of sanctioned combat, the modified psychology becomes unstable. Recommendation. Astartes' units should never be left without active deployment for periods exceeding three standard months. They are weapons that must be used. The implications were devastating. The Space Marines, our greatest defenders, were fundamentally incapable of creating or maintaining the very peace they supposedly fought for. Their existence necessitated eternal war. And as the dominant military force in the Imperium, their influence had shaped our entire civilization. We had become a society, built around accommodating the needs of our transhuman protectors. A society that could not conceive of existence without conflict because its greatest heroes could not function without it. I found further evidence in deployment records spanning thousands of years. Space marine chapters consistently sought out combat even when strategic considerations did not warrant it. Crusades were extended beyond their objectives. Pacified regions were abandoned for new war zones rather than garrisoned. The pattern was clear to me now. The Adeptus Astartes were not fighting to achieve peace, They were fighting because they could do nothing else. But the most damning evidence came from a sealed report dating back to the final days of the unification wars on terror, a time when the Emperor still walked among us, directing humanity's future with his own hand. The document detailed a meeting between the Master of Mankind and his inner circle of scientists and generals. The Lord of Terror has expressed concern about the long-term societal implications of the Astartes program. While acknowledging their necessity for the coming Great Crusade, he recognizes that a post-Crusade civilization will require their strategic dismantling or significant modification. Plans are being developed for the eventual transition of power from transhuman forces to baseline human governance once the galaxy is secured. The Emperor had intended the Space Marines to be temporary, a necessary evil to unite the scattered worlds of humanity, after which they would be phased out to allow a truly human society to flourish. But history had not followed his design, the Horus heresy had changed everything. In its aftermath, the Space Marines had become more entrenched, more necessary, more revered. I sat back in my chair, the weight of these revelations pressing down upon me. The Space Marines had not saved humanity. They had condemned us to an eternity of warfare by their very nature. The Imperium celebrated them as heroes, while failing to understand that their existence made peace impossible. That their transhuman psychology had infected our entire civilization, reshaping human culture into one that glorified combat and martyrdom because our greatest champions could comprehend nothing else. And yet, what alternative did we have? Without the space marines, how could humanity possibly survive in a galaxy filled with horrors? The question haunted me as I continued my research, hoping to find some glimpse of the future the emperor had originally envisioned. some path forward that might free us from this cycle of perpetual war. I found no such comfort in the archives, only deeper, darker truths waiting to be unearthed. My search through the archives took on a feverish intensity after these discoveries. I began to neglect meals and sleep, driven by the need to understand the full scope of what the Emperor had intended with his transhuman warriors. The tech priests monitored my activities with increasing suspicion, but my inquisitorial mandate kept them at bay. For now, on the seventh day of my research, I discovered references to something called the Primaris Contingency. The files were heavily encrypted, requiring authorization far beyond what my clearance should have allowed. But the ancient systems had vulnerabilities, pathways created during the early days of the Imperium and forgotten over the millennia. I exploited one such pathway, my conscience quieted by the conviction that I served a greater truth. What I found shattered what remained of my faith. The Primaris Astarte's, the new generation of space marines introduced in recent centuries, were not a new creation at all. Their template had existed since the earliest days of the Astartes project. The Emperor had created two distinct transhuman designs. The first, what we now know as the standard space marines, were always intended to be temporary, effective but fundamentally flawed. The Primaris represented the second, stage, warriors who were supposed to be deployed only after the galaxy was conquered to serve a different purpose entirely. According to the original plan, once the Great Crusade succeeded in uniting all human worlds under imperial rule, the standard space marines would be gradually phased out, allowed to die in battle without replacement. The Primaris would then be awakened not as warriors, but as governors. Their enhanced bodies would contain additional modifications not present in the first generation Astartes. modifications to restore emotional capacity, empathy, and the ability to build rather than destroy. The Emperor had designed the Primaris to transition humanity from conquest to civilization. They were to be the administrators of peace, using their enhanced intellects and extended lifespans to guide humanity into a new golden age. Their combat capabilities were meant to be secondary, a final line of defense rarely needed in a unified Imperium. The Horus heresy had changed everything. With the Emperor confined to the Golden Throne, the complete Primaris template was hidden away, preserved but never implemented as intended. Instead, ten thousand years later, a twisted version was deployed. The physical enhancements remained, but the psychological modifications that would have restored humanity to the transhuman frame were never activated. The Primaris became simply more efficient killers, perpetuating the cycle of violence rather than breaking it. I found a personal notation from Archmagos Dominus Belisarius Call. the tech priest who supposedly developed the Primaris Marines in the 41st millennium. The psychological modification subroutines in the original template would render the Primaris unsuitable for current imperial needs. In an imperium beset by enemies on all fronts, warriors who question the necessity of violence would be a liability rather than an asset. I have selectively implemented the physical enhancements while suppressing the empathic Restoration Protocols. The Primaris will be superior combatants, unhindered by moral hesitation. Our best hope for escaping endless war had been corrupted into a tool to perpetuate it. The Primaris, who might have guided us toward the peaceful civilization the Emperor envisioned, had instead become another generation of transhuman warriors who could comprehend nothing but conflict. Yet, as I continued to research the original Primaris template, I discovered something that kindled a dangerous hope within me. The complete genetic modification protocols still existed, buried deep within the archives. The knowledge to create transhumans capable of peace had not been lost, merely suppressed. If implemented, it could potentially transform the nature of the Astartes, aligning them with the Emperor's original vision. Such knowledge was beyond dangerous. It was existentially threatening to the Imperium as it now existed. the Imperial Creed, the Adeptus Astartes, the endless crusades that defined our civilization. All would be undermined by the revelation that the Emperor had intended a fundamentally different future for mankind. I should have deleted the files, should have purged my research, and written the sanitized history I had been commissioned to create. Instead, I copied the Primaris psychological modification protocols and hid them within my personal data slate. Not with any grand plan for implementation, but out of a scholar's instinct to preserve knowledge, no matter how forbidden, it would prove to be my fatal error. As I exited the archive chamber that night, I found myself confronted by three robed figures waiting in the shadows of the corridor. Two wore the crimson of the Mechanicus. The third was clad in the black coat and silver insignia of the Inquisition. Archivist Holt, the Inquisitor said, his voice soft, yet carrying the unmistakable edge of authority. Your research activities have triggered certain monitoring protocols. You have accessed information, beyond your clearance level. I clutched my data slate tighter, feeling the weight of the forbidden knowledge it contained. I have an inquisitorial mandate to compile a comprehensive history of the Adeptus Astartes. The High Lords themselves commissioned this work. Indeed. The Inquisitor nodded, stepping closer. In the dim light, I could see his face was heavily augmented, one eye replaced with a whirring mechanical orb that focused on me with unnerving intensity. But your mandate specified beta-level archives only. You have been accessing omega-level material for the past three days. I swallowed hard, mind racing for a plausible explanation. The cataloguing system is ancient. I may have inadvertently strayed beyond my authorized areas while following relevant historical threads. The inquisitor's augmented eye word as it adjusted its focus. An understandable error for a man of your experience and dedication, one easily remedied. you will surrender your data slate for inspection and purging of unauthorized material. In that moment, I knew I faced a choice that would define whatever remained of my life. Surrender the data slate and with it, the last hope of the Emperor's original vision, or refuse, and face the consequences of possessing forbidden knowledge. I thought of the Imperium as it existed. Endless war. Countless billions sacrificed to feed the insatiable machine of conflict, Space Marines venerated as heroes while ensuring, by their very nature, that peace would never be possible. The data is encrypted, I said, my voice steadier than I expected, linked to my personal cogitator in my quarters. I would need to decrypt it before you could access the relevant files. A transparent lie, but one that might buy me time." The inquisitor studied me for a long moment, his human eye narrowing slightly. Very well. You will be escorted to your quarters immediately. Once the data is accessible, you will be brought before a formal inquiry to explain your actions. As the tech priests flanked me, I realized I had merely postponed the inevitable. By morning, the inquisition would have the forbidden knowledge, and I would face judgment for my transgressions. But perhaps that was time enough, time to ensure the truth would not die with me. The space marines should never have been made. Not as they were. Not as engines of endless war, incapable of building the peace they supposedly fought for. The Emperor had known this, had planned for their eventual obsolescence. If humanity was ever to escape the cycle of violence, that truth needed to survive. As we walked toward my quarters, I began to formulate a desperate plan. One last act of defiance against the endless darkness that had consumed the Imperium of Man. One final attempt to preserve the Emperor's true vision for humanity's future. Whether I would succeed, only time would tell. The journey to my quarters within the vast Mechanicus complex felt like a death march. The tech priests flanked me closely, their expressionless augmented faces betraying nothing of their thoughts. The inquisitor followed several paces behind, his augmatic eye humming softly as it continuously scanned our surroundings. My mind raced, calculating possibilities, most ending with my execution. My modest living space reflected my temporary status at the archive, a Spartan room containing a narrow bed, a desk with a cogitator terminal, and a small shrine to the emperor. The latter was standard issue rather than personal devotion, another lie in a life built upon them. You have thirty minutes to decrypt your research, the Inquisitor stated flatly. I will wait outside. The tech priests will remain with you to ensure no files are destroyed. I nodded, moving to the cogitator terminal with practiced calm I did not feel. My hands trembled slightly as I activated the ancient machine, its mechanisms whirring to life. The tech priests positioned themselves on either side of me, mechanical eyes, tracking every movement of my fingers across the keys. This is sensitive historical research, I said, forcing confidence into my voice. The High Lords themselves commissioned this work. The High Lords do not authorize access to Omega-level archives, one of the tech priests responded, voice flat and mechanical. Your mandate was explicitly limited to beta-level information. I had no response to that undeniable truth. Instead, I focused on the terminal, making a show of entering complex decryption commands while my mind worked on a different problem entirely. The data slate containing the Primaris psychological modification protocols sat on the desk beside me. Within it lay the evidence that the Emperor had intended the Space Marines to be temporary, and had created a path to transition from endless war to civilization. Evidence that would be destroyed the moment the Inquisitor reviewed it, unless I could somehow preserve it, send it beyond their reach. As my fingers moved across the ancient keyboard, I surreptitiously activated a secondary function on the cogitator. All Mechanicus facilities maintained connection to the Noah sphere, the vast data network that linked their installations across the galaxy. Most information flow was tightly controlled, but there existed forgotten pathways. Emergency protocols established during the Horus heresy and never removed from the system. The decryption is proving more difficult than anticipated. I said, buying time as I navigated the labyrinthine digital architecture beneath the cogitator's main interface. I implemented multiple security layers to protect the historical integrity of my research. One of the tech priests leaned closer, mechadendrites extending from his back to interface directly with my terminal. Your methods are inefficient. I will accelerate the process. No, I said quickly, perhaps too quickly. The encryption is keyed to my specific access patterns. External interference will trigger an automatic data purge. Another lie. But the tech priest hesitated, his mechadendrites hovering inches from the interface port. In that moment of hesitation, I found what I sought. A dormant emergency transmission protocol, designed to broadcast critical information, should a Mechanica's facility fall to enemy forces. A digital lifeline meant for desperate circumstances. Exactly what I needed, With practiced motions developed over decades of archival work, I created a compressed data packet containing the most damning evidence I had discovered. the Emperor's original plans for the Space Marines, the Primaris psychological modification protocols, the assessment showing that Astarte's psychology made peace impossible, all formatted with explanatory notes added during my research. As I worked, I maintained a steady stream of commentary about the decryption process, describing fictitious security measures and authentication protocols, The tech priests watched closely but could not follow everything I was doing. They were specialists in machine maintenance, not archival systems. Then came the moment of truth. With a subtle sequence of commands disguised as part of the decryption process, I uploaded the compressed data packet to the emergency broadcast system and set it to transmit to three distant Mechanicus facilities. Locations so far from Terra that they operated with significant autonomy. Places where the information might find fertile ground before the Inquisition could contain it, the transmission would not happen immediately. I set a delayed activation, timed for after my inevitable interrogation would begin. By the time the Inquisition realized what I had done, the information would already be beyond their reach. Just as I completed the final command sequence, the door to my quarters slid open. The Inquisitor stood framed in the doorway, his augmatic eye glowing red in the dim light. Your time is up, Archivist Holt. Has the decryption been completed? I turned from the date, terminal, struggling to keep my expression neutral. Yes, Inquisitor. The files are now accessible. He stepped into the room, extending a gloved hand for my data slate. Then you will surrender all research materials and accompany me for formal questioning. I handed over the slate, knowing it was now merely a decoy. The real information was already flowing through hidden channels of the Noah sphere, beyond even the Inquisition's reach. Still, I felt a chill as his fingers closed around the device. You have accessed information regarding the Emperor's original design for the Astatis, he said, his natural eye studying my face for reaction. Information that contradicts 10,000 years of imperial doctrine. I did not deny it. There was no point. I sought the truth of our defenders, as commissioned. Truth, the Inquisitor said, the word leaving his lips like a curse. The Imperium is not built on truth, archivist. It is built on necessary fictions that allow humanity to survive in a hostile galaxy. As he gestured for me to proceed him out of the room, I could not help but respond. Even fictions that ensure we will fight forever, never knowing peace, the inquisitor's expression hardened peace is a luxury humanity cannot afford the space marines ensure our survival that is all that matters i said nothing more as i was led from my quarters but in my silence lay the hope that soon others would know what i had learned that the emperor's original vision might yet find those willing to fight for a different future a future where transhuman warriors might protect humanity without condemning it to eternal war the inquisition would extract everything i knew Of that, I had no doubt. But they would be too late to contain the information I had set loose in the Noah sphere. Too late to prevent others from learning that the Space Marines, our greatest heroes, had doomed us to an eternity of violence by their very existence. As we walked through the shadowed, corridors of the archive complex, I felt a strange sense of peace. For the first time in my long career of writing the approved histories of the Imperium, I had finally served the truth. Whatever happened next, that could not be taken from me. The interrogation chamber deep beneath the archive complex had clearly been designed for its current purpose, despite the Mechanicus claiming it was merely a secure examination room. The walls were lined with sound dampening material. The single door reinforced with adamantium. The chair I was secured to was bolted to the floor, restraints positioned to allow limited movement while preventing any meaningful resistance. They did not resort to physical torture immediately. The inquisitor, who finally introduced himself as Callistroff of the Ordo Hereticus, began with methodical questioning. His manner was almost collegial, as if we were engaged in scholarly debate rather than an interrogation that would likely end with my execution. Your academic credentials are impressive, archivist Holt, he said, reviewing a data slate containing my service record. Fifty years of loyal service to the Tiberius Historical Foundation. Numerous commendations for your historical accounts of Astarte's campaigns. The Mosharian Crusade compilation was particularly well received. I remained silent, recognizing the technique for what it was. Establish rapport before the questioning turns hostile. I had interviewed enough Imperial Guard veterans to know the approach. which makes your recent activities all the more perplexing." Kalistrov continued, setting down the slate and fixing me with his mismatched gaze. Why would a historian of your standing risk everything to access forbidden knowledge? What did you hope to achieve? The question seemed genuine, underpinned by actual curiosity rather than mere interrogative procedure. I considered my response carefully. I sought the truth. I said finally, my voice rough from hours without water. The High Lords commissioned a comprehensive history of the Adeptus Astartes. I could not fulfill that commission without understanding their origins. Callistroff leaned forward slightly. The origins of the Space Marines are well documented in imperial records. Their creation by the Emperor's hand to defend humanity against the darkness of the galaxy. Their heroism during the Great Crusade. Their loyalty during the Horus Heresy. This is known. It is believed, I countered. But it is not the truth. A shadow passed across the inquisitor's face. And you presume to know this truth based on fragments of ancient data. Records corrupted by time and the fallibility of technology. The records I found were not corrupted, I replied, feeling a dangerous defiance rising within me. What did I have to lose now? They were deliberately hidden. suppressed because they contradicted the myth of the Astartes that the Imperium has cultivated for ten millennia. Callistroff signaled to one of the tech priests, who stepped forward with a device I recognized as a neural agitator, not painful in the traditional sense, but capable of stimulating the brain's fear centers directly. torture without marks let us be direct archivist the inquisitor said his tone hardening you accessed information regarding the emperor's original intentions for the space marines information suggesting they were designed to be temporary warriors rather than humanity's eternal defenders that their psychology makes them incapable of creating peace I nodded, seeing no reason to deny what he clearly already knew. And most damning, Kalistrov continued, you discovered the Primaris psychological modification protocols. Information that, if implemented, would fundamentally alter the nature of the Adeptus Astartes. Information that would fulfill the Emperor's original design, I corrected. That would transform the Space Marines from engines of perpetual war into builders of civilization. As he intended, before the heresy trapped us in this nightmare of endless conflict, the neural agitator hummed to life in the tech priest's mechanical hands. Kalistroff regarded me with something approaching pity. You fail to understand the fundamental truth of our existence, archivist Holt. the galaxy does not permit peace the emperor recognized this even if he once dreamed otherwise zenos that would exterminate us without hesitation the ever-present threat of chaos the countless horrors lurking between the stars humanity survives only through constant vigilance and strength of arms The space marines ensure we will never know anything but war, I argued. Even as the tech priest moved behind me with the neural agitator, their psychology shapes our entire civilization. They cannot conceive of existence without conflict, and so neither can we. And you believe peace is possible? Kalistroff asked, genuine curiosity in his voice. that if the Astartes were modified according to these ancient protocols, humanity would suddenly live in harmony with the galaxy. I hesitated, feeling the cold metal of the neural agitator press against the base of my skull. I believe the Emperor thought it was possible, that he created the Space Marines with an exit strategy. A way to transition from conquest to civilization once the galaxy was secured. The galaxy will never be secured, Kalistrov said with absolute conviction. The Horus heresy proved that. Half our defenders turned against us. The dream of a unified human empire died with that betrayal. The neural agitator activated, sending waves of artificial fear cascading through my nervous system. I gasped, my body rigid with terror that had no external source. Every shadow in the room seemed to writhe with unspeakable threats. Every sound became a harbinger of doom. Through it all, Kalistroff's voice continued, somehow cutting through the manufactured panic. Where did you send the information, archivist? We know you transmitted something from your quarters. Our tech priests confirmed it once we began examining your cogitator. Where did you send the Primaris protocols? I tried to resist, to focus through the overwhelming fear. But the agitator adjusted, intensifying the effect until rational thought became nearly impossible. Through chattering teeth, I finally answered. Mars, Riser, Griffon IV. Emergency transmission protocols established during the heresy. Kalistroff nodded to the tech priest who deactivated the agitator. The artificial fear receded like a tide, leaving me drained and shaking. The inquisitor tapped a command into his data slate, presumably alerting his colleagues to intercept my transmissions. It will be contained, he said with quiet confidence. The noosphere pathways to those forge worlds will be severed if necessary. The information will not spread. Despite my exhaustion, I managed a weak smile. You cannot contain it forever. The Emperor designed the Space Marines to be temporary, created a path to peace through the Primaris. That knowledge exists now, beyond just me. Eventually, it will find those willing to implement it. Kalistrov studied me for a long moment. You truly believe you are serving the Emperor's will. That is what makes you dangerous rather than merely misguided. He stood, straightening his black coat. The Primaris Marines were deployed as warriors because that is what humanity needs. not because Belisarius Call suppressed some aspect of the Emperor's design, but because the Emperor's design was adapted to our reality. A reality of permanent war. A reality the space marines themselves perpetuate, I countered. Their psychology makes them need conflict. They shape our entire society toward endless crusades because they can comprehend nothing else. "'Enough,' Kalistrov said, his patience evidently exhausted. "'You have revealed the destination of your transmission. "'That is all I required.' He turned to the tech priests. "'Continue the—interrogation. "'Extract everything he knows about the Primaris protocols "'and any other forbidden knowledge he accessed. "'Be thorough. "'As he moved toward the door, I called after him. "'The Space Marines should never have been made as they were.' The Emperor knew this. You know this. How many trillions more must die in endless war before we acknowledge this truth? Kalistrov paused at the threshold. The alternative is extinction. Archivist Holt. The Space Marines ensure humanity's survival in a hostile universe. Whatever the cost, it is one we must pay. Then he was gone. leaving me with the tech priests and their devices. The neural agitator hummed to life once more, but this time it was joined by other, more physically invasive instruments. I closed my eyes, preparing for what would come next. They would extract everything I knew, every fragment of forbidden knowledge I had discovered in the archives. But they were already too late. The transmission had been sent hours ago. By now, the information would have reached at least one of the designated forge worlds, would have found its way into the hands of tech priests outside the Inquisition's immediate reach. Whether anything would come of it, I could not know. But the truth was loose in the galaxy now, like a virus in the bloodstream of the Imperium. A truth that contradicted 10,000 years of doctrine, the Space Marines, humanity's greatest heroes, had doomed us to eternal war by their very existence. As the pain began in earnest, I found comfort in that small victory. In that moment of defiance against the endless darkness that had consumed the Imperium of Man, perhaps somewhere in the vast galaxy, someone would use what I had discovered to fulfill the Emperor's original vision, to create transhuman defenders capable of building peace rather than ensuring endless war. It was more hope than I had felt in decades of loyal service. The interrogation lasted for days, physical pain blurred with neural manipulation, and sleep deprivation until time lost all meaning. The tech priests were methodical, extracting every fragment of information I had gleaned from the restricted archives. Every nuance of the Primaris psychological modification protocols, every detail of the Emperor's original design for the Adeptus Astartes, I told them everything. There was no point in resistance once the neural blockers were administered, chemicals that bypassed my conscious control and left my mind open to their probing. But it did not matter. The information was already beyond their reach, transmitted to distant forge worlds through channels established during the Horus heresy itself. Channels designed to function even if terror fell. On what I believe to be the fifth day, Inquisitor Kalistrov returned. He looked tired, the human portions of his face drawn with exhaustion. He dismissed the tech priests with a gesture, waiting until we were alone before speaking. Your transmissions never reached their destinations, he said without preamble. The emergency protocols you utilized were compromised centuries ago. They redirect to inquisitorial monitoring stations rather than their intended recipients. I said nothing, uncertain whether to believe him. It could easily be a lie meant to break what remained of my spirit. The information has been contained," he continued, circling my restraint chair slowly. The Primaris psychological modification protocols have been purged from every system you accessed. The evidence of the Emperor's original intentions for the Space Marines has been eliminated. You cannot eliminate truth, I managed, my voice a ragged whisper after days of screaming. The Emperor designed the Space Marines to be temporary, created the Primaris as a transition to peace. That knowledge exists in the archives, waiting to be discovered by others. Kalistroff stopped his circling, standing directly before me. The archives have been purged of all such references. The sections you, accessed, have been physically removed and destroyed. As far as the historical record is concerned, the information never existed. For the first time, despair threatened to overwhelm me. Had my suffering been for nothing, had the truth been so easily erased why i asked the single word containing all my accumulated anguish why perpetuate this cycle of endless war why not fulfill the emperor's original vision kalistrov's expression softened slightly and he pulled a stool closer to sit facing me When he spoke, his voice was quieter, almost intimate. Because it would destroy us, Remis, he said, using my given name for the first time. Not immediately, perhaps, but inevitably. You discovered only fragments of the Emperor's design, incomplete pieces of a larger plan. The Space Marines were indeed created to be temporary, but not because peace was the ultimate goal. I frowned, confused by this new direction. The documents were clear. The primaris psychological modifications were designed to restore empathy, creativity, the capacity to build rather than destroy. Yes, Kalistrov nodded, but to what end? Did you ever ask yourself why the Emperor would create transhuman warriors only to later transform them into transhuman builders? Why not simply use unmodified humans to govern once the galaxy was conquered? I had no answer. It was a question I had not considered during my feverish research. Because humanity itself was meant to be temporary, Kali Strav said softly. The Space Marines were the first stage, the Primaris II. both stepping stones toward the Emperor's true goal, the complete transcendence of humanity into a fully psychic race. My mind reeled at the implication. That cannot be true. The Emperor foresaw the psychic awakening of mankind. Kalistroff continued relentlessly. Knew that eventually every human would develop powers similar to his own, but such an awakening would attract the attention of the ruinous powers, as it did with the Eldar. would lead to our extinction through a cataclysm born of our own psychic potential. he leaned closer, his augmatic eye whirring softly as it adjusted focus. The space marines were created not merely to conquer the galaxy, but to prepare humanity for controlled transcendence. Their psychological limitations, the very aspects you believed were flaws, were designed to make them resistant to chaos. The primaris modifications were meant to be the next stage, allowing for expanded consciousness while maintaining that resistance. Then why abandon the plan? I asked, struggling to process this new information. Why leave us trapped in this cycle of endless war instead of proceeding with the emperor's design? Because the heresy proved the design was flawed, Kallistrov replied. half the primarchs the emperor's own sons fell to chaos despite all his precautions the controlled transcendence he envisioned was revealed to be impossible the risk of a psychic apocalypse too great he stood pacing the small chamber as he continued The Imperium as it exists now was not the Emperor's first choice. It is a contingency, a holding pattern designed to preserve humanity until another solution can be found. The constant warfare, the suppression of psychic potential in the general population, the technological stagnation. All necessary to prevent our premature evolution into a psychic race that would immediately be consumed by chaos. I shook my head. refusing to accept this justification for ten thousand years of slaughter and oppression. Even if what you say is true, the current imperium is unsustainable. Trillions die in endless wars while we slowly lose ground on every front. How is this preferable to attempting the emperor's original plan however risky? because the original plan would guarantee our extinction," Kalistrov said with absolute conviction. While our current path, grim as it is, offers the possibility of eventual salvation, the Emperor still guides us from the Golden Throne, still works toward humanity's survival through means we cannot comprehend. He reached into his coat and withdrew a small device I recognized as a neural eraser. My heart sank at the sight of it. Such devices were used to selectively remove memories, leaving the subject functional but missing specific knowledge. You accessed information you were never meant to have, Remis, Kalistroff said, his tone almost gentle. Information that threatens the very foundation of the Imperium. I cannot allow that knowledge to remain, even confined within a single mind. You mean to erase everything I learned, I said, not a question but a statement of the inevitable. Yes. But not to execute you, as protocol would demand. He held up the neural eraser, checking its settings. Your service record speaks of genuine loyalty to the Imperium. Your actions, while misguided, stemmed from a desire for truth rather than malicious intent. You will be returned to the Tiberius Historical Foundation with modified memories of your time here. you will complete the commissioned history of the adeptus astatis using approved sources only i laughed then a bitter sound in the sterile chamber so i am to continue creating the very myths i sought to dispel to perpetuate the lies that keep humanity locked in endless war You are to continue serving the Emperor as you always have," Callistroff corrected. By preserving the necessary fictions that allow humanity to survive in a hostile universe. By maintaining the faith in our transhuman defenders that gives ordinary citizens the courage to endure in a galaxy of horrors. As he moved behind my restraint chair with the neural eraser, I made one final attempt to preserve some fragment of the truth I had discovered. Wait, I said quickly, before you erase my memories. Tell me one thing honestly, Inquisitor. Do you truly believe the current Imperium is what the Emperor would want? This endless cycle of war and suffering with no hope of peace. Kalistroff paused, the neural eraser hovering near my temple. For a long moment, he was silent, and I thought he would not answer. Then, so quietly, I barely heard it. No. But it is what he knew would be necessary after the heresy destroyed his original vision. Sometimes survival requires sacrifice, even the sacrifice of hope itself. Then the neural eraser activated, and darkness claimed me. I awoke in my quarters at the Tiberius Historical Foundation on Terra, my head pounding with the worst migraine I had experienced in decades of scholarly work. The room was familiar, comforting in its Spartan efficiency. Data slates containing approved historical accounts lined the shelves. My desk was neatly organized, the ancient cogitator humming softly as it processed information. Something felt wrong, but I could not identify what. a sense of lost time, of missing memories. According to my personal chronometer, I had returned from the Mechanicus archives three days ago after successfully completing my research for the commissioned history of the Adeptus Astartes. Yet I had no clear recollection of my final days there, or of my journey back to the foundation. Medical records indicated I had suffered a minor cerebrovascular event while working in the archives. Nothing serious. but enough to affect short-term memory formation. The attending medicaid had prescribed rest and a reduced workload for several weeks. It seemed reasonable enough. I was, after all, in the twilight of my career. Seventy-three years of loyal service to the Imperium had taken their toll on my aging frame. Yet something continued to nag at the edges of my consciousness. a sense that i had discovered something important something that had been taken from me i pushed the feeling aside and turned my attention to the commissioned history according to my notes i had already outlined the entire work and completed the first three sections the space marines as the emperor's gift to humanity their glorious service during the great crusade their steadfast loyalty during the horace heresy all standard historical narratives compiled from approved sources yet as i reviewed what i had written i felt a strange revulsion the words seemed hollow the narrative constructed rather than discovered i found myself staring at a particular passage about the psychological profile of the adeptus astartes the transhuman warriors of the emperor exemplify the highest virtues of mankind Their enhanced bodies are matched by enhanced minds, focused entirely on the defense of humanity. Their devotion to duty and capacity for self-sacrifice represent the pinnacle of human potential. something about those words felt fundamentally wrong a lie wrapped in the trappings of truth but why would i think such a thing i had spent my entire career chronicling the heroism of the space marines had always believed in their essential role as humanity's defenders i was still pondering this dissonance when a chime indicated a visitor at my door a quick check of the security feed revealed a figure in the black coat and silver insignia of the inquisition my heart rate inexplicably accelerated at the sight a surge of adrenaline coursing through my system as if in response to a perceived threat enter I called, my voice steadier than I expected given my physical reaction. The door slid open to reveal a man with extensive augmatic modifications. One eye had been replaced with a mechanical orb that worded softly as it focused on me. I felt I should recognize him, but no name came to mind. Archivist Holt. He greeted me with a slight bow. I am Inquisitor Callistroff of the Ordo Hereticus. I have come to check on your progress with the commissioned history. The Ordo Hereticus? I frowned. I was under the impression this project was commissioned directly by the High Lords through standard administrative channels. The High Lords have a vested interest in ensuring the accuracy of this particular historical account, Callistroff replied smoothly." Given the importance of the adeptus astatis to imperial security, the Inquisition has been asked to provide oversight. It seemed plausible enough. Yet I could not shake the feeling that there was more to his presence than he claimed. The way his augmatic eye continuously scanned my quarters. The careful neutrality of his expression. He was looking for something. My progress has been satisfactory, I said, gesturing to the data slate containing my work, though my recent medical incident has slowed things somewhat. The first three sections are complete and conform to all approved historical templates. Kalistrov picked up the slate and quickly scanned its contents. Excellent. Your reputation for thoroughness is well deserved, archivist. And your recovery progresses well? Well enough. some minor memory issues from around the time of the incident. Nothing that affects my work. The Inquisitor nodded, setting down the slate. Memory is a curious thing, is it not? So easily distorted or manipulated. A blessing, perhaps, given some of the horrors our species has witnessed across the millennia. There was something in his tone that triggered a flash of emotion in me. Anger? Fear? I could not identify it precisely, but it felt intense and immediate. Indeed, I replied carefully. Though as a historian, I value accuracy in recollection. Our understanding of the past shapes our navigation of the present. A noble sentiment, Kalistrov said, moving toward the small shrine to the emperor that stood in the corner of my quarters, standard issue like those found in most imperial facilities though sometimes the full truth of history must be reserved for those prepared to bear its weight the common citizen requires simpler narratives you mean propaganda i said the words leaving my mouth before i could consider their wisdom calistroff turned sharply his augmatic eye focusing on me with unnerving intensity an interesting choice of words archivist halt Do you consider your historical chronicles to be propaganda? I hesitated, uncertain why I had spoken so carelessly to an inquisitor. I meant no offense. I merely meant that history is often simplified for general consumption. The full complexity of events, with all their contradictions and moral ambiguities, is preserved in the scholarly record. indeed kalistrov said though his gaze remained fixed on me for several uncomfortable seconds and your current work does it capture the full complexity of the adeptus astatis another flash of emotion surged through me a sense of wrongness so profound it was almost physical It follows all approved historical templates," I replied, choosing my words with extreme care. The space marines are presented as the Emperor intended them to be understood, as humanity's greatest defenders against the darkness of the galaxy. Kalistrov nodded slowly, seemingly satisfied with my response. Excellent. I look forward to reviewing the completed work." He moved toward the door, then paused. One more thing, archivist. During your research at the Mechanicus Archives, did you encounter any information that contradicted the approved historical narrative regarding the Astartes? The question triggered a cascade of physical responses. Elevated heart rate. Perspiration. A tightness in my chest that made breathing difficult. Yet I had no conscious memory of discovering anything unusual during my research. Nothing significant. I managed, fighting to keep my voice steady. Some minor discrepancies in dates and deployment numbers. The usual inconsistencies one finds in records spanning ten millennia. The inquisitor studied me for a long moment, his human eye narrowing slightly. Then he nodded. Very good. Continue your excellent work, Archivist Holt. The Emperor protects." The Emperor protects, I echoed automatically. After he left, I sat at my desk for a long time, staring at the unfinished history before me. My head throbbed with pain that seemed centered around specific memories, or rather, their absence. What had I found in those archives? What had triggered the Inquisition's interest in a routine historical commission? I had no answers, only a growing certainty that something fundamental had been taken from me. Knowledge that had threatened someone or something powerful enough to warrant inquisitorial intervention. With trembling hands, I returned to my work, continuing the approved narrative of the Adeptus Astartes as humanity's greatest heroes. As I wrote, a single thought kept intruding, rising from someplace deeper than conscious memory. the space marines should never have been made. I had no idea why I believed this, yet the conviction remained unshakable and profound. I continued writing the historical account as commissioned, filling it with the familiar myths of transhuman heroism and sacrifice. But something had changed within me. Some seed of doubt had been planted that even the neural eraser could not completely remove. and as i worked i began to notice patterns in the historical record that i had overlooked before the endless nature of astartes campaigns The way conquered worlds were abandoned for new conflicts rather than properly integrated into the Imperium. The psychological evaluations that hinted at transhuman minds, fundamentally incapable of conceptualizing peace as anything but a temporary pause between wars. Small discrepancies that, taken together, suggested a troubling possibility. That the Space Marines, our greatest heroes, had had locked humanity into an eternal cycle of violence from which we could never escape, that their transhuman psychology had infected our entire civilization, reshaping human culture into one that glorified combat and martyrdom because our greatest champions could comprehend nothing else. I could not prove this hypothesis, could not, remember discovering any concrete evidence to support it. Yet the conviction remained, fueling a quiet act of rebellion within the confines of my commissioned history. Between the lines of approved narrative, I began to embed subtle questions, implications that invited the careful reader to look deeper, to consider whether the Imperium's endless crusades truly served humanity's interests, or merely perpetuated a cycle of violence that benefited only those who could not imagine life without war. It was dangerous, of course. If the Inquisition detected my subversion, I would face far worse than a neural eraser. But something drove me forward, some fragment of truth that had survived their attempt to remove it from my mind. The Space Marines should never have been made, not as they were, not as engines of endless war, incapable of building the peace they supposedly fought for. I could not remember why I believed this with such certainty. Could not recall discovering any evidence to support this heretical thought. But as I completed the commissioned history, carefully conforming to all approved templates while seeding it with subtle doubts, I felt I was serving a greater truth. One that transcended the comfortable myths the Imperium had constructed around its transhuman defenders. When the work was finally complete, I submitted it through the proper channels, knowing it would be reviewed thoroughly before being sealed in the secure vaults on terror. Most likely, the Inquisition would detect my subtle subversion and purge it before archival. My small act of rebellion would come to nothing. But perhaps, just perhaps, some echo of the truth would survive. Some hint that the Emperor had intended something different for humanity than an eternity of warfare. that the space marines, for all their heroism and sacrifice, had locked us into a path that could lead only to slow extinction. As I prepared for retirement, my health failing after decades of service, I often thought about what I might have discovered in those Mechanicus archives. What knowledge had been deemed too dangerous to remain, even in a single loyal mind? I would never know for certain. But the conviction remained, unshakable and profound. The Space Marines should never have been made, not as they were. My final act as Chief Archivist was to ensure that my commissioned history, with all its subtle questions and implications, was duplicated and distributed to multiple secure locations. Standard procedure for works of historical significance, though I took care to include several repositories that operated with significant autonomy from Terra. Perhaps one day, someone would read between the lines of my carefully constructed narrative, would notice the patterns I had highlighted through careful emphasis and juxtaposition, would begin asking the questions I could no longer remember discovering the answers to. Perhaps one day, humanity would find a path beyond endless war. would fulfill whatever vision the Emperor had originally held before the Horus heresy trapped us in this nightmare of eternal conflict. I could not remember discovering such a vision, but I believed with absolute certainty that it had existed, that somewhere in the vast archives of the Imperium, the truth still waited to be found, by those brave enough, or foolish enough, to seek it.

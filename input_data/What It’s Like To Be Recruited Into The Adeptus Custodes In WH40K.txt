i was nine when they came for me nine terran years of false life everything before that day is ash now fragmented memories that no longer feel like my own but i remember the test the small silver needle that pricked my finger during routine examinations at the scola progenium I remember the proctor's face changing when he saw the readout. How he left without a word, returning with three others who stared at me with expressions I could not decipher. Not then. The next morning they came. Not drill abbots or instructors, but giants in crimson robes, their faces hidden beneath deep hoods. They spoke not to me but about me, as if I were livestock being appraised at market. The markers are strong in this one, one said. Another placed a hand on my shoulder. His grip was painful, inhumanly strong. Potential candidate, he said. The words hung in the air, spoken with something approaching reverence. I did not cry when they took me. The Shola had beaten such weakness from me long before. I walked with my head high between my crimson guardians, through halls that fell silent as we passed. The faces of my fellow orphans watched from doorways, some curious, others afraid, none spoke, none dared. I remember thinking how proud my instructors would be of my composure, how I was surely being selected for some great honor, perhaps even induction into one of the sacred orders that served the god-emperor directly. I was a fool. They brought me to a shuttle, sleek and golden, bearing insignia I did not recognize. Inside waited more of the crimson-robed figures, and one other, a giant among giants, clad in Oromite armor that gleamed with an inner light, a custodian, Even at nine years old I knew what he was. Every child of the Imperium is taught to revere these golden warriors, the Emperor's own guardians. His face was stern, ageless, as if carved from the same material as his armor. He looked at me once, nodded slightly, then turned away. We lifted from Terra's surface in silence. Through the viewports, I watched as the sprawling hive cities shrank beneath us. The worlds I had read about in my lessons, the battlefields where I had imagined I would one day serve, the entire galaxy of possibilities that had seemed to stretch before me, all vanishing into the void as we approached our destination. the imperial palace, not the public processional's or even the outer fortifications where pilgrims might glimpse the emperor's domain from afar. We descended into a hidden port, a mouth in the mountainside that swallowed our vessel whole. When the ramp lowered, the air that greeted me was cold and sterile, heavy with the scent of incense and something else. Something metallic and sharp that made my skin crawl. "'This way, candidate,' said one of the crimson robes. It was the first time any of them had addressed me directly. I followed, my small steps quickening to match their stride. We passed through corridors of such grandeur that my scola upbringing, sparse as it was, seemed luxurious by comparison. Everything here was stone and metal, ancient beyond reckoning yet immaculately preserved. There were no decorations, no concessions to comfort or aesthetics beyond the brutal magnificence of scale, The ceiling soared hundreds of meters above, supported by columns as thick as hab blocks. The floors were polished to a mirror sheen, reflecting our procession like a dark pool. They brought me to a chamber where others waited. Children like me, though some seemed older, others younger, all boys, all with the same expression of guarded confusion. None spoke. We had not been told not to speak, but something in the air, in the oppressive silence of this place, kept our voices locked in our throats. I counted twenty-seven of us in total. We stood in perfect rows, as we had been taught in the scola, back straight, eyes forward. Hours passed. Some of the younger children began to fidget. A boy to my right started to tremble. I kept my gaze fixed on the far wall, on an inscription carved in high Gothic that I could not quite translate. I focused on the letters, on their precise angles and curves, rather than the growing discomfort in my body or the fear that had begun to gnaw at the edges of my mind. When the doors finally opened, it was not the crimson robes who entered, but three custodians. Their armor caught the light, throwing golden reflections across our faces. Their helmets were off, revealing faces that might have been brothers, might have been statues. Perfect, expressionless, inhuman in their symmetry. I am shield Captain Arakhan, said the center one. His voice was deep, resonant, yet devoid of emotion. You have been identified as potential candidates for the greatest honor the Imperium can bestow. You will be tested. You will be transformed. Most of you will fail. Those who do will serve the emperor in other ways. There was something in the way, he said, other ways that made my blood run cold. From this moment, you are no longer children. You are no longer individuals with names and pasts. You are raw material, nothing more. The weak marble is discarded. Only the perfect stone becomes the statue." He surveyed us, his gaze passing over each face without recognition, without compassion. Your first test begins now. Follow. Do not speak. Do not fall behind. He turned and walked away, his golden brothers flanking him. We followed, a small procession of children trailing three demigods through the bowels of the Imperial Palace. The corridors narrowed, the grandeur giving way to utility. The air grew colder, the light dimmer. We walked for what felt like hours, through identical passages that turned at precise right angles, creating a labyrinth that I quickly lost track of. The first boy fell behind near the sixth hour. A small child, perhaps seven years old. His legs simply gave out, his exhausted body collapsing to the floor. None of us dared to stop and help him. The custodians never broke stride, never looked back. We heard the boys' sobs fade behind us, then a door opening, then silence. By the twelfth hour, six more had fallen. My own legs burned with fatigue. My lungs roar from the increasingly thin air. We had not been given food or water. The temperature had dropped steadily until I could see my breath fogging before me. Still, we marched on. I fixed my eyes on the back of the boy ahead of me, forcing my leaden feet to match his pace. I would not fail, not at the first test, not before I even knew what honor awaited. When we finally stopped, only fifteen of us remained. We stood in a circular chamber, its walls lined with what appeared to be sleep chambers, though they looked more like sarcophagi than beds. The shield captain turned to face us. You will sleep now," he said. When you wake, the next phase will begin. I remember the relief that flooded through me. Sleep. Rest for my aching body. I all but stumbled to the nearest chamber as its front panel slid open with a pneumatic hiss. Inside was a hard surface covered with a thin layer of some gel-like substance. I lay down, feeling it conformed to my body. The panel closed, sealing me in darkness. I expected to lie awake, to feel claustrophobic in this coffin-like enclosure. Instead, consciousness fled almost immediately, drawn away by some soporific agent pumped through vents I could not see. My last thought before the darkness took me was a question that would haunt whatever dreams visited me in that artificial night. What had happened to the boys who fell behind? I awoke to pain, not the dull ache of overexerted muscles or the gnawing emptiness of hunger. This was something else entirely. Sharp, precise, surgical. My eyes snapped open to blinding light and the silhouettes of figures moving around me. I tried to speak, to ask what was happening, but my throat produced no sound. I tried to move, to raise a hand, to turn my head. Nothing responded. I was paralyzed, conscious, but immobile, aware of, everything but able to affect nothing. Subject shows increased neural activity, said a voice. Not the deep tones of the custodians, but something higher, more clinical. Consciousness resumed. Proceed with the first grafts, said another voice. Pain threshold testing will follow. I felt something cold press against my arm, then a sensation like liquid fire flowing into my veins. The pain intensified, spreading through my body in waves. I would have screamed if I could, would have thrashed and fought if my limbs obeyed. Instead, I lay perfectly still, a prisoner in my own flesh, as they systematically introduced agony into every cell of my being. Time lost meaning, there was only pain, and brief interludes where the pain receded enough for me to form coherent thoughts again. During one such respite, I became aware that I was no longer in the sleep chamber but on some kind of operating table. Medical servitors moved around me, their mechanized limbs making soft whirring sounds as they worked. Above me, a cluster of lenses focused and refocused, recording every detail of whatever was being done to my body. Neural mapping complete, announced one of the voices. Compatibility at 78%, higher than expected for the age group. The emperor's blood runs strong in this one, said another voice, lower, more reverent. Proceed with phase one augmentation. More pain followed, but different now, deeper. as if they were rewriting something fundamental in my very being. I felt changes happening within me, cellular transformations that my nine-year-old mind could not comprehend, but my nerves registered in excruciating detail. I remember thinking, in a moment of clarity between waves of agony, that this must be what the creation of an Astartes felt like, that I was being remade as one of the Emperor's Space Marines. I was wrong. what was being done to me was far more invasive far more complete the space marines are mass-produced weapons created by thousands from worthy stock what i was undergoing was artisanal a painstaking reconstruction of a human being into something else entirely Not one change but thousands, each building upon the last, each carefully monitored and adjusted. My body was not being enhanced, it was being erased and rewritten. When I next regained consciousness, I was back in the sleep chamber. The pain had receded to a dull throb that pulsed with my heartbeat. I discovered I could move again, though every motion sent fresh sparks of discomfort through my altered nervous system. I raised a hand before my eyes, and almost did not recognize it as my own. The fingers were longer, the joints more pronounced, the skin seemed to glow faintly from within, as if infused with trace amounts of the same material that comprised the custodian's armor. The chamber opened, and I stepped out into the circular room again. The other survivors were emerging as well, each moving with the careful deliberation of someone adjusting to a body that no longer quite fits. I counted eleven now, four more lost to whatever screening process had occurred while we were under the knife. Shield Captain Arakan waited in the center of the room, flanked by white-robed figures whose features were hidden behind smooth, expressionless masks. Tech priests of some specialized order, I guessed, though they bore no obvious markings of the Adeptus Mechanicus. The first transformation is complete, said Arrakhan. Four of your number were found wanting. Their genetic material has been repurposed to serve the emperor in death as they could not in life. You eleven have passed the first threshold. Many more await. He gestured to the tech priests, who stepped forward, each carrying what appeared to be a simple metal rod." You will now begin physical conditioning. Your bodies have been prepared, now they must be tested. What followed was not training as I had understood it at the scola. There were no drills, no exercises, no instructors demonstrating proper technique. Instead, we were pitted against servitors in combat scenarios of increasing difficulty. The metal rods, I quickly discovered, were training weapons that delivered painful but non-lethal energy discharges when they struck flesh. The servitors wielded them with inhuman precision, targeting vulnerabilities, exploiting weaknesses. We fought for hours without rest. When a boy fell, unable to continue, the tech priests would drag him away. Sometimes he would return, sometimes he would not. I took blow after blow, my newly enhanced body absorbing punishment that would have killed my former self. I learned to anticipate the servitors' movements to counter their mechanical precision with adaptability they could not match. By the end of that first session, my body was covered in angry red welts, but I remained standing. Three more boys had disappeared. This became our existence. Wake, fight, endure pain, sleep. The sleep chambers, I later understood, were not merely for rest but for continued transformation. Each time I emerged, my body had changed in subtle ways. Stronger, faster, more resilient. My mind, too, was being altered. I could process information more quickly, retain perfect recall of complex tactical scenarios, calculate trajectories, and force vectors instinctually. Weeks passed, or perhaps months. There was no way to mark time in those windowless chambers. No day or night, only the rhythm of training and transformation. We did not speak to one another, these strange boys who were becoming something other than human alongside me. We had no names now, only designations. I was candidate seven. Once, I had been called Derek Vaughan. That name grew distant in my memory, belonging to someone else, someone who had died on an operating table beneath the Imperial Palace. The eight remaining candidates were gathered one cycle in a new chamber. Larger than the others, its walls lined with weapons of ancient design. At its center stood not servitors, but three custodians in full battleplate, their guardian spears held at rest position. You have been remade, said Shield Captain Arakan, who stood to one side observing. Your bodies have been purified. Your minds have been conditioned. Now you must prove your worth in true combat." The custodians raised their spears in perfect unison. You will attack as one unit, continued Arakan. You will fight until you can no longer stand. Those who show courage, skill, and tactical acumen will proceed to the next phase. Those who do not will be repurposed. There was no signal to begin. One moment we stood in wary anticipation, the next we were in motion, charging forward as if driven by a single will. I found myself moving in concert with the others, our individual fighting styles meshing into a coordinated assault. We had never trained together, never communicated our intentions, yet we functioned as a perfect unit. Another change wrought upon us, another way in which we were being shaped into something beyond human. the custodians were holding back that much was clear even so they moved with a speed and grace that made our enhanced bodies seem clumsy by comparison their spears danced blocking our attacks delivering painful counters but they did not strike to disable, only to test. We landed no blows, could not even come close to penetrating their defenses, yet that did not appear to be the purpose of the exercise. After what felt like ours, one of the candidates, candidate three, broke formation. Instead of continuing the coordinated assault, he attempted a reckless solo attack, perhaps thinking to distinguish himself with an impressive display of individual prowess. The custodian he targeted sidestepped with contemptuous ease, spinning his guardian spear in a blur of motion that caught candidate three across the chest. The blow sent him flying across the chamber to crash against the far wall with a sickening crack. He did not get up. The remaining, seven of us continued our assault, adjusting our strategy to account for the loss. We moved in shifting patterns, testing the custodian's defenses from multiple angles, seeking any weakness. There were none to be found. Eventually, exhaustion took its toll. One by one, candidates began to falter, their movements slowing, their coordination breaking down. I fought on, drawing on reserves of stamina I had not known I possessed. In the end, only three of us remained standing when shield Captain Arakan finally called a halt to the exercise. Myself, Candidate 12, and Candidate 5, the others lay on the chamber floor, some unconscious, some merely too exhausted to rise. Servitors entered and began to drag them away. I did not allow myself to wonder where they were being taken. The final phase awaits, said Arrakhan. You three have shown the potential required. Now you will be unmade and reforged for the last time. The sleep chambers that awaited us were different from the others. Larger, more complex, lined with arcane technology that hummed with barely contained power. As I was sealed inside, I caught a glimpse of Candidate 12's face through the closing aperture." There was something in his eyes, something I recognized from my own reflection, not fear precisely. We were beyond that now. But a question, unspoken yet profound, what would remain of us when this final transformation was complete? The answer, when it came, was both more and less than I had imagined. I awoke not to pain this time, but to its absence. A profound stillness pervaded my consciousness, as if some fundamental noise that had accompanied my entire existence had suddenly been silenced. I opened my eyes to golden light filtering through a high vaulted ceiling. I lay upon a slab of marble, unrestrained. When I sat up, I moved with a fluid grace that felt simultaneously alien and natural, as if I had always possessed this body but was only now inhabiting it fully. Shield Captain Arakan stood before me, but he seemed different now. Not physically altered, but my perception of him had changed. I saw him not as a terrifying godlike figure, but as a peer. Different in experience, in knowledge, but of the same essential nature. Rise, custodian, he said. I stood, becoming aware of my new dimensions. I towered over my former height, my body reshaped into something magnificent and terrible. Muscles moved beneath skin that shimmered with a subtle golden luminescence. I felt immensely strong, immensely fast. My senses sharpened to a degree that would have overwhelmed my former self. Only you remain, said Arakan. The others were found wanting in the final trials. Their genetic material has been harvested for future attempts. You alone have proven worthy of ascension. I should have felt triumph, I suppose. Pride at having survived where twenty-six others had failed. Instead, I felt nothing. No joy, no relief, no sense of accomplishment, just a calm acceptance of fact. I had not won a competition. I had simply been the marble that did not crack under the sculptor's chisel. You will now receive the final blessing." Arakan continued. Your armor awaits in the Chamber of Ascension. But first, you must complete one last ritual. He led me through corridors that seemed both familiar and new to my enhanced senses. We passed custodians standing guard at various intersections, each nodding slightly in acknowledgement as we walked by. Not of me, I understood, but of Arakan. I was not yet one of them, not completely. We came to a small circular room with a single item at its center, a plain wooden box, ancient and worn, its surface inscribed with symbols I now found I could read. They spoke of renunciation, of sacrifice, of the surrender of self to a higher purpose. Open it, said Arakan. I stepped forward and lifted the lid. Inside lay a simple piece of parchment and a ceremonial knife with a golden hilt. Write your name upon the parchment, he instructed. The last time it will ever be written or spoken. I took the knife, its weight perfectly balanced in my new hand. I cut the tip of my finger, watching as blood welled up, darker and thicker than human blood should be. Another change, another transformation. I wrote the name that seemed increasingly distant, increasingly meaningless. Derek Vaughan. Now burn it, said Arakan, producing a small brazier that I had not noticed before. Its coals glowed with intense heat. I placed the parchment upon the coals and watched as it blackened and curled, the letters of my former identity vanishing into smoke and ash. As the last corner turned to ember, I felt something break free within me. Not pain, not this time, but a kind of release. The final tether connecting me to the child I had once been, severed clean. From this moment forward, you have no name," said Arakhan. You are a custodian of the Emperor. His will is your purpose. His protection is your only duty. All else is irrelevant. He placed a hand upon my shoulder, the first gesture of comradeship he had ever shown me. In time, you will earn a name among us. It will not be the one you surrendered. That belonged to a mortal child who no longer exists. Your new designation will reflect your role in the Imperium's defense. We proceeded to the Chamber of Ascension, a vast circular space dominated by a central dais. Upon it stood a suit of custodian armor, gleaming in the light of a thousand candles. Not the full battleplate I had seen before, but a simpler version. Sentinel armor, I knew somehow, designed for guards of the inner sanctums rather than for war beyond the palace walls. Tech priests moved forward, beginning the ritual of armoring. Piece by piece, the Oramite shell was attached to my body, each component perfectly fitted to my new dimensions. With each addition, I felt myself becoming more complete, as if the armor were not an external covering but an integral part of my being. When the final piece was secured, I stood resplendent in gold, a perfect instrument of the Emperor's will. Shield Captain Arakan approached, holding a guardian spear. Not a training weapon, but a true custodian armament, ancient and potent. This is solemnity, he said, presenting the weapon to me. It has served seventeen custodians before you. Each gave his life in the emperor's service. You will be its eighteenth wielder, serve as they did, with unwavering devotion. I accepted the spear, feeling its balance, its perfect weight. it was as much a part of me as my armor as my transformed body together we were something more than the sum of our parts something that no longer required a name to define its purpose your first post will be the sanctuary of whispered names said arakan a fitting assignment for one who has just surrendered his own. You will stand guard for 100 hours without relief. This is your final test. Not of body or skill, but of focus and devotion. He led me through more corridors, deeper into the heart of the palace complex. We descended countless steps, passed through security barriers that would have been impenetrable to anything short of a Titan assault. Finally, we reached a simple archway leading to a long, narrow hall, At its end stood a plain door of dark wood, unmarked and unadorned. Beyond lies the sanctuary, said Arakhan. None may enter save the Emperor himself, should he ever rise from the Golden Throne, or a custodian shield captain during the Feast of Blades. You will permit no one else to pass, regardless of rank or authority. You will stand vigil until relieved, without movement, without speech. He stepped back, regarding me with eyes that had witnessed ten millennia of such assignments. Many find this duty the hardest of all. The body can be trained, the mind conditioned, but the spirit must find its own discipline. Some cannot bear the solitude, the silence. They break. They are repurposed. I understood then that my trials were not truly over. perhaps they never would be. The testing of a custodian was eternal, the standards never lowering, the expectations never diminishing. I took up position before the door, planting the haft of solemnity upon the floor, assuming the stance I had observed in the palace guards. The Emperor protects, said Arakhan, turning to leave. The Emperor protects, I responded, my voice deeper and more resonant than I remembered, The last words I would speak for one hundred hours. As his footsteps faded, I was left alone with my thoughts. They were surprisingly quiet. The fears, doubts, and desires that had once filled my human mind were absent, replaced by a crystalline clarity of purpose. I was exactly where I was meant to be, doing exactly what I was meant to do. The concept of self-importance had been carefully excised during my transformation, leaving only duty in its place. Hours passed. I did not move. My enhanced physiology required no rest, no food, no water for such a relatively brief vigil. My mind remained alert, my senses attuned to every subtle shift in my surroundings. I heard the distant echoes of footsteps, the soft hum of ancient machinery buried in the walls, the barely perceptible whisper of air through ventilation shafts. Nothing approached my post. Nothing disturbed my solitude. I found myself reflecting on my journey, not with emotion but with analytical detachment. The child, Derek Vaughan, seemed a stranger to me now, a half-remembered dream figure whose experiences held academic interest but no emotional resonance. I reviewed the stages of my transformation, identifying the precise moments when humanity had been stripped away layer by layer, replaced with something more enduring, more purposeful, The genetic restructuring had been first, a foundation upon which all else was built. Then the hypno-conditioning, implanting knowledge and reflexes directly into my synapses. The muscle grafts, the skeletal reinforcement, the organ implantation, each. Procedure precisely calculated, each change building upon the last. The physical transformations were extensive but straightforward. It was the psychological conditioning that truly separated me from my former self. They had taken a child with dreams, hopes, and fears, and methodically replaced those human traits with absolute devotion to a single purpose. Not through crude indoctrination as the Astartes underwent, but through subtle neurological rewiring. Certain pathways strengthened, others atrophied or severed completely, the capacity for doubt eliminated. The ability to question authority excised, compassion focused to a laser point directed solely toward the object of our protection. Yet something remained, some core of awareness that recognized the magnitude of what had been sacrificed. Not with regret, that capacity had been removed, but with a form of understanding that transcended emotion. I had been unmade and reforged. The raw material of a human child had been transformed into something post-human, neither greater nor lesser, simply different. Optimized for a singular purpose that would define my existence for millennia to come. At the 70th hour of my vigil, I detected movement. footsteps approaching, too light for a custodian, too measured for a servitor. I remained motionless, but my senses heightened, tracking the sound as it grew closer. A robed figure appeared at the far end of the hallway, walking with the careful deliberation of extreme age. As it approached, I saw it was a woman, ancient beyond measure, her withered face a map of wrinkles and age spots. Her eyes, however, were sharp and clear, taking my measure as she stopped several paces away. So you are the new one, she said, her voice surprisingly strong. Arakan mentioned you showed exceptional promise. I did not respond. My orders had been clear. No speech, no movement. The silent treatment, she chuckled. Very proper. I am Amalthea, keeper of the Sanctum Archives. I have. Overseen the records of custodian inductions for three thousand years. I have seen many come and go, standing where you now stand. She stepped closer, peering up at my face with undisguised curiosity. You still have it, you know. That look in your eyes, the ones who succeed always do. A kind of distance, as if you're seeing everything from the far side of a great chasm. The others, the ones who fail this final test, they still look hungry. Seeking something, approval perhaps, or meaning. You expect nothing, that is good. Expectation leads to disappointment, and disappointment leads to doubt. She circled me slowly, her aged hands clasped behind her back. I am authorized to enter the sanctuary of whispered names, she said suddenly. I catalog the identities preserved therein. Step aside and allow me passage. I remained motionless. Shield Captain Arakan's instructions had been explicit. None may enter save the Emperor himself or a custodian shield captain during the Feast of Blades. No exceptions, regardless of claimed authority." very good she nodded approvingly you would be surprised how many fail at this point authority can be a seductive thing especially when wielded by one as venerable as myself but you recognize the absolute nature of your orders the emperor's will brooks no compromise no matter how reasonable the request might seem She studied me for a moment longer, then turned to leave. You will do well among the ten thousand, she said over her shoulder. Remember this moment when you maintained your vigil despite temptation. It will not be the last test of your resolve. Her footsteps receded down the corridor, leaving me alone once more with my thoughts and the silent door I guarded. Had she been a genuine test, I wondered, or simply an ancient archivist with a habit of tormenting new inductees? It made no difference. My duty remained the same regardless of her identity or purpose. The remaining hours of my vigil passed in silence. When, Shield Captain Arakan finally returned, exactly one hundred hours after he had left, I had not moved a millimeter from my assigned position. My mind remained clear, my focus unwavering. If anything, the extended period of stillness had sharpened my awareness rather than dulling it. Your vigil is complete, said Arakan. You have proven worthy of your place among the Adeptus custodians." I straightened from my guard position, the movement smoothed despite the lengthy immobility. My enhanced physiology had prevented any stiffness or discomfort that a normal human would have experienced. You encountered Amalthea, he stated, not a question but a certainty. Yes, Shield Captain, I responded, my voice sounding strange to my ears after so long unused. She has tested every new custodian for three millennia. Some consider her methods unorthodox. I find them effective. She identified a weakness in your predecessor that our more traditional screening had missed. He was repurposed before he could bring shame to our order. There was something final in the way Arakan said, repurposed, a weight that suggested more than mere reassignment. I did not ask for clarification. the fate of those who failed was not my concern only duty mattered now you will be assigned to the outer hegemon squadrons continued arachan there you will learn the practical aspects of your role from veterans who have served for thousands of years listen well to their instruction they have witnessed the decline of the imperium first-hand and understand the gravity of our responsibility he gestured for me to follow leading me away from the sanctuary and back toward the upper levels of the palace complex. As we walked, he spoke of the different shield companies, their specialties and histories. He explained the rotation of duties, from the outermost defensive rings to the hallowed ground of the throne room itself. He described the martial traditions, the philosophical disciplines, the private rituals, that bound the custodians together as something more cohesive than a mere military organization. Through it all, I listened with perfect recall, absorbing every detail, committing each word to my enhanced memory. Yet a question formed in my mind, one that I finally gave voice to when he paused. Shield Captain, I said, what purpose does the sanctuary of whispered names serve? Arakan stopped walking, turning to regard me with an evaluative gaze. For a moment, I wondered if I had committed some breach of protocol by asking, Then his expression softened, marginally, the way mountains might soften their outline at twilight. It houses the names, he said simply, all the names that we surrender upon our induction, written in our blood upon parchment, preserved for eternity. It is said that should the Emperor rise from his throne, He would speak each name aloud, returning to us what we sacrificed in his service. He resumed walking, his golden armor catching the light from ancient glow-globes set into the ceiling. It is a comfort to some, knowing that their mortal identities are not truly lost, merely set aside. I find such sentiment unnecessary. We are what we have become, not what we once were. The past is irrelevant, only duty remains. We emerged into a vast chamber where dozens of custodians were engaged in martial exercises. They moved with fluid precision, their oramite armor gleaming, their guardian spears whirling in complex patterns that spoke of millennia of refined technique. Some practiced alone, others in pairs or small groups. All maintained a focused silence, broken only by the sound of metal on metal, and the controlled rhythm of superhuman breathing. these are your brothers now said arakan not in the crude biological sense of the astartes but in purpose and dedication learn from them fight alongside them stand vigil with them until the stars grow cold or the emperor calls us to his side in the final battle He placed a hand on my shoulder, a gesture of formal acceptance rather than human warmth. You have no name, but you have an identity. You are one of the ten thousand, the Emperor's Praetorians, the Watchers on the Walls. In time, you will earn a designation that reflects your role and character. Until then, simply be worthy of the transformation you have undergone. With that, he left me among my new companions. one gold-clad giant among many indistinguishable to the casual observer united in our post-human perfection and singular devotion i stepped forward to join an empty practice circle raising solemnity in salute to the custodian who would be my first sparring partner He nodded in acknowledgement, his face as impassive as my own. As our weapons met in the first exchange of a battle that would last for hours, I felt the last vestiges of my former identity fade completely. Derek Vaughn was truly gone now. His ashes scattered, his blood dried upon parchment locked away in a sanctuary few would ever see. In his place stood something greater and more terrible. A golden automaton of perfect loyalty, a weapon fashioned in human form, a guardian who would never tire, never falter, never question. I would serve for thousands of years, watching Imperium rise and crumble in slow motion around the unchanging core that was the palace. I would outlive everyone who had ever known the child I once was, I would witness the slow decay of humanity's realm while standing in perfect, unchanging vigilance. And if I performed my duty with perfect dedication for ten thousand years, my reward would be to continue doing so until death finally claimed me. That is the truth of becoming custodian, not glory, not honor, not even sacrifice, for sacrifice implies choice. We are selected before we understand the implications. We are remade before we can comprehend what we are losing. By the time we recognize the totality of our transformation, we no longer possess the emotional capacity to mourn what was taken from us. The hypno-indocronation chambers had implanted certain knowledge directly into my cortex during the final phase of my rebirth. I knew the full history of the custodian guard, from their creation during the unification wars to their long, silent vigil, after the emperor's interment upon the golden throne. I knew the names and deeds of heroes long dead, warriors who had stood where I now stood, who had surrendered their identities just as I had done. I knew the precise dimensions and layout of the imperial palace could navigate its labyrinthine corridors blindfolded if necessary. I knew a thousand fighting styles, a thousand weapons, a thousand ways to kill with maximum efficiency. What I did not know, could no longer comprehend, was the simple joy of human connection. The comfort of a name spoken in kindness. The warmth of belonging to something smaller and more intimate than an immortal brotherhood of demigods. Such things were alien concepts now, as incomprehensible to me as the colors beyond ultraviolet are to an ordinary human eye. The days blended into years, the years into decades. I served in the outer Hegemon squadrons, then the Tharunatoy, then the Ephoroi. I stood guard over secret vaults containing weapons of such power that their existence was known to perhaps a dozen individuals in the entire Imperium. I escorted tech priests of the highest rank to perform maintenance rituals upon the arcane machinery that kept the Emperor's withered body clinging to the barest thread of life. I walked the hollow spaces between the walls of the palace, ancient tunnels where no ordinary human had set foot since the heresy. In my 207th year of service, I received my designation. I had been assigned to guard a section of the palace known as the Gallery of Glass, a long corridor whose walls were lined with stasis fields containing thousands of crystal sculptures. Each depicted a moment from imperial history, crafted by artisans long dead, preserved in perfect stasis for eternity. I had stood there for three years, unmoving, unwavering, when a custodian of the companions, the most honored guard who stood vigil in the throne room itself, approached. The emperor's eyes fell upon a report of your service today, he said, his voice carrying the weight of one who spoke for the master of mankind." He noted your perfect stillness, your absolute focus. In his wisdom, he has designated you Epimetheus, after an ancient figure said to possess hindsight of perfect clarity. I accepted the designation without pride, without emotion. It was merely a practical label, a means of distinguishing me from my identical brothers in situations where such distinction was necessary. Yet some small, deeply buried part of me, some fragment of the human child that had not been completely excised, felt a spark of something at this recognition. Not joy, but perhaps its distant cousin. A muted acknowledgement that my service had been noted by the one being whose opinion held any meaning in my transhuman existence. Epimetheus. The name settled upon me like the final piece of armor completing my transformation. I was no longer a nameless guardian. I was epimetheus of the Adeptus Custodians, designated by the Emperor himself, tasked with eternal vigilance in his name. The centuries continued their slow march. I fought when fighting was required, though such occasions were rare for custodians during this relatively stable period of imperial history. More often, I stood vigil, a golden statue observing the slow dance of politics and power that swirled through the palace corridors. High Lords came and went. Crises arose and were resolved. Wars raged across the galaxy, reports of their progress filtering back to terror in the form of data slates and astropathic communiques that I sometimes guarded as they passed from hand to hand among the imperial elite. None of it touched me." I was separate from the Imperium I protected, observing its workings with the detached interest of a scientist studying insects beneath a magnifying glass. Human concerns seemed increasingly trivial, their urgency amusing in its transience. What were their fleeting lives compared to my centuries of service? What were their petty conflicts compared to the eternal war against the enemies of mankind? In my fifth century of service, I was assigned to the Chamber of Echoes, a small circular room deep within the palace where the emperor was said to have conducted certain arcane experiments before the heresy. The chamber was perfectly constructed to amplify and redirect sound waves, creating overlapping patterns of resonance that could, under specific conditions, tear holes in the fabric of reality itself. My duty was to ensure that no unauthorized personnel entered, that no unsanctioned sounds disturb the delicate acoustics of the space. I stood alone in that room for fifty years. I heard the whispers that emanated from the walls when certain harmonics aligned with the movements of Terra's artificial tides. I witnessed the spectral apparitions that sometimes formed in the center of the chamber, echoes of beings that had briefly manifested there millennia ago during the Emperor's experiments. I catalogued each phenomenon, reported them dutifully to shield Captain Diocletian, who had assumed Arakhan's position following the latter's death in battle against a daemon incursion in the sub-levels. It was there, in that chamber of perfect solitude, that I experienced the closest thing to introspection that my conditioned mind would allow. Not emotion, not regret, but a form of existential awareness that transcended my programming. I began to perceive patterns in my own consciousness, to recognize the artificial nature of certain mental barriers that had been erected during my creation. I could not breach those barriers, could not even desire to breach them, but I could acknowledge their presence. This awareness did not diminish my loyalty or dedication. If anything, it crystallized my understanding of my purpose, distilled it to its purest essence. I protected the Emperor not because I had been conditioned to do so, though I had, not because I revered him as a god, for custodians alone among imperial servants knew the truth of his mortality. I protected him because his vision for humanity, flawed and incomplete as it might be, represented the sole hope for our species in a galaxy overflowing with horrors. My transhuman perspective allowed me to see the grand tapestry of his design in ways that ordinary humans, with their limited lifespans and understanding, could not. When I was finally relieved from my post at the Chamber of Echoes, I emerged changed in subtle ways that only another custodian might have perceived. There was a depth to my gaze that had not been present before, a quality of perception that went beyond the merely physical. Shield Captain Diocletian noted it immediately when I reported for reassignment. "'The chamber has left its mark on you, Epimetheus,' he said, studying my face with eyes that had witnessed the heresy itself. Few stand vigil there for as long as you did. Fewer still emerge with their sanity intact. I am uncompromised, shield captain, I assured him. My dedication is absolute. I do not question your loyalty, he replied, but I recognize the look of one who has glimpsed beyond the veil. The emperor himself bore such an expression after certain of his more esoteric workings. It is not necessarily a liability, provided it is properly channeled. he consulted a data slate its surface inscribed with glowing runes that shifted and rearranged themselves under his gaze you will be assigned to the sanctum imperialis he said finally the companions have requested a guardian of your particular qualities you will serve in the outer ring of the throne-room itself, Epimetheus. There is no higher honor nor greater responsibility. I accepted the assignment, without visible reaction, though that buried fragment of humanity within me trembled at the implications. The throne-room, the physical presence of the Emperor himself, The heart of the Imperium, the nexus around which the fate of the entire human race revolved. I would stand in that most hallowed of spaces, would breathe the same air that circulated around the master of mankind's desiccated form. If there was purpose to my existence, it would be found there, in the direct service of him who had ordered my creation. The sanctum imperialis was unlike any space I had guarded before. The psychic pressure was immense, a constant weight upon the senses that ordinary humans could not have endured for more than moments without their minds shattering. Golden lights effused everything, not the artificial illumination of glow-globes but a radiance that emanated from the throne itself, from the withered figure upon it that still, despite millennia of decay, shone with divine power. I could not look directly at the emperor. None could. save the Captain General of the Custodians and the Fabricator General of Mars during their rare audiences. Instead, I fixed my gaze upon the space before me, upon the small portion of the vast chamber that was my specific responsibility to guard. I was one of two hundred custodians present at any given moment, each assigned to a precise position, each focused upon a specific sector of defense. Together, we formed an impenetrable barrier between the emperor and any who would do him harm. Time passed differently in the throne room. Hours stretched and compressed, subject to the psychic tides that ebbed and flowed from the God-Emperor's consciousness. Sometimes a watch that should have lasted eight hours seemed to pass in minutes. Other times, each second dragged with excruciating slowness, as if reality itself were being pulled apart and reassembled with painstaking deliberation. It was during one such distorted period when each moment hung. suspended like a drop of amber, that I heard it, a whisper, so faint that even my transhuman hearing barely registered it. A name, spoken with the dusty remnant of what might once have been affection. Derek, I did not move, did not respond, my conditioning was too complete, my discipline too perfect to react to such an obvious hallucination. The emperor did not speak, had not spoken aloud in ten thousand years. And even if he could, he would certainly not address a single custodian by a name that had been surrendered centuries ago. Its letters turned to ash, its syllables locked away in a forbidden sanctuary. But the whisper came again, more insistent this time, Derek Vaughan. You guard well. A psychic projection then. Not a physical voice but a directed thought. Focused with pinpoint precision upon my mind alone, I remained outwardly motionless, but my thoughts raced with unprecedented urgency. Was I being tested? Was this some new form of screening designed to identify custodians whose loyalty might be compromised by lingering attachments to their former identities? No. The pressure behind the words was unmistakable. The same pressure that filled the chamber that radiated from the Golden Throne. Somehow, impossibly, the Emperor's fractured consciousness had focused momentarily upon me, had plucked my surrendered name from whatever metaphysical repository held such things, and had chosen to acknowledge my service in this most personal of ways. I felt no pride, no joy, no gratification. Such emotions had been carefully excised during my transformation, but I felt something, a resonance, a profound sense of rightness, as if some cosmic equation had balanced itself in that moment of recognition. My purpose, which had always been clear in an intellectual sense, acquired a depth of meaning that transcended mere duty or doctrine. The whispering ceased. The moment passed. Time resumed its erratic flow. I continued my vigil without deviation, without acknowledgement of what had occurred. None of my brother custodians gave any indication that they had perceived anything unusual. The experience, if it was indeed real, and not some unprecedented malfunction in my enhanced nervous system, had been meant for me alone. When my watch ended and I was relieved by another custodian, I returned to my Spartan quarters in the custodian barracks. Unlike the Astartes, we did not sleep in communal dormitories. Each of us had a private cell, small but sufficient for our limited needs. We required little sleep, perhaps an hour in every ten, and spent most of our off-duty time in meditation, training, or studying the ancient texts that contained the accumulated wisdom of our order. I seated myself upon the stone floor, assuming the position of contemplative readiness that custodians had practiced since the days of unification. I closed my eyes, regulated my breathing, and allowed my mind to enter a state of focused tranquility. Not the emptiness of traditional meditation, but a disciplined examination of my own consciousness, a systematic review of my thoughts and perceptions. The Emperor had spoken to me, or at least, some fragment of his shattered psyche had momentarily coherent enough to direct a thought in my direction. The implications were staggering, yet I analyzed them with the cool detachment that characterized all custodian thought. What did it mean? What was required of me in response? Had my brothers received similar communications, kept private as I had done, no conclusions presented themselves. No course of action seemed indicated beyond maintaining my vigilance, my dedication to duty. If the emperor had more to communicate, he would do so in his own time, in his own way. My role was not to question or interpret, but to serve, always to serve. Centuries passed. I continued my rotation of duties, standing watch in the throne room when called upon, serving elsewhere in the palace during intervening periods. I fought in the brief but brutal Melkor uprising, when a cabal of rogue Sykers attempted to breach the palace defenses through a combination of warp craft and treachery. I stood vigil over the sacred oil fields of Pluto during the War of the False Primarch, when certain traditional duties fell to the custodians due to the extended deployment of Astartes' forces. Through it all, I heard no further whispers from the throne. The experience neither faded from my memory nor occupied undue attention, It simply was, a singular event in a life measured in centuries, noteworthy but not definitive. My identity remained, Epimetheus, custodian of the Adeptus Custodes, the name Darek von belonged to history, to a child who had ceased to exist in any meaningful sense until the day of Ascension. The Ecclesiarchy had declared a new holy day to commemorate an obscure saint whose deeds had been recently rediscovered in ancient archives. The imperial palace was overflowing with pilgrims, permitted into certain public sections to pay homage to relics and icons housed there. Security was heightened throughout the complex, with particular attention paid to the boundaries between public and restricted areas. I was assigned to one such boundary, a grand archway that separated the pilgrim's path from the processional of the righteous, a corridor reserved for high-ranking administratum officials and ecclesiarchy representatives. My instructions were simple. Allow only those with proper authorization to pass. Use lethal force against any who attempted to breach the checkpoint without appropriate credentials. For hours, I stood in perfect stillness as the crowds of pilgrims flowed around my position, careful to maintain their distance from the imposing figure in golden armor who barred their path to the inner sanctums. They stared in awe, whispered prayers, occasionally prostrated themselves before moving on. I registered their presence but paid them no particular attention. They were simply part of the environment, neither threat nor concern, unless they violated the established boundaries. Then, in the midst of the afternoon processional, I saw her. An elderly woman, her back bent with age, her face a web of wrinkles that spoke of a life measured in its natural span rather than the artificial longevity of the imperial elite." She wore the simple robes of a pilgrim from one of the Agri-worlds, unadorned save for a small pendant that caught the light as she moved. She walked with the aid of a gnarled staff, her progress slow but determined. There was nothing remarkable about her appearance, nothing that should have drawn my attention amidst the thousands of pilgrims who passed that day. Yet something in her posture, in the way she carried herself despite the obvious pain of movement, triggered a response in my enhanced memory, a flicker of recognition that should have been impossible. She stopped before me, tilting her head back to gaze up at my towering form. Her eyes were pale blue, clouded with cataracts but still alert, still aware. She studied me for a long moment, her expression unreadable. Then she spoke, her voice barely audible even to my sensitive hearing. Derek Vaughn, she said, not a question. A statement of absolute certainty. I did not respond, could not respond. My conditioning, my training, my very nature as a custodian precluded any acknowledgement of that name, especially when uttered by a civilian in a public space. I remained motionless, my guardian spear held at perfect attention, my eyes fixed on the middle distance above her head. You don't remember me, she continued, her voice strengthening slightly. Why would you? I was just one of many at the Scola. Sister Helene. I taught literacy to the younger children. You were one of mine, for a time, before they took you. Something stirred within me, a memory that should have been erased or at least rendered emotionally inert by the procedures I had undergone. A small classroom, rows of worn wooden desks, a younger version of this woman, her hair still dark, her back still straight, patiently guiding my hand as I formed letters on a sheet of parchment. A kind voice in a place where kindness was scarce. I recognized you, she said, her roomy eyes searching my impassive face for any hint of response. Not your appearance, of course. You're transformed beyond recognition. But your essence. There's a quality to your stillness that was present even then. A watchfulness. An awareness. I've looked for you, you know. For decades. Visited terror whenever my duties permitted. walked the public sections of the palace, hoping to catch a glimpse. And now, at the end of my life, here you are. I should have signaled for Servitors to remove her. Her words were inappropriate, potentially disruptive to my assigned duties. Yet I did not. Some long, dormant part of me, some fragment of the human child that had been systematically dismantled and rebuilt, wanted to hear what she would say next. I'm dying, she said simply. Cancer, untreatable at my age and station. I came to Terra one last time, to pray at the foot of the palace before the end. I never expected to find you. To confirm what I've always suspected about where they took the special ones. She reached into a pouch at her belt and withdrew a small worn book, its cover faded with age and handling. You made this, she said, holding it up for me to see." In my class, a collection of stories about the Emperor's great victories. Your handwriting was always so precise, even then. I kept it when they came for you. A remembrance of a bright child lost to higher service. She placed the book on the ground at my feet, her movements slow and deliberate. I don't expect you to speak to me. I know what you've become, what was done to you. But I wanted you to know that someone remembers Derek Vaughn. that not every trace of who you were has been erased from the universe. She straightened as much as her aged spine would allow, meeting my gaze directly. The Emperor protects, she said, the traditional phrase carrying a weight of meaning beyond its literal interpretation, a benediction, a farewell, an acknowledgement of the gulf that separated us. The Emperor protects, I replied, the words emerging unbidden, spoken not in the resonant tones of Epimetheus the custodian, but in a voice that carried the ghost of a child long dead. Sister Helene's eyes widened, a single tear tracking down her wrinkled cheek. She nodded once, then turned and walked away, disappearing into the crowd of pilgrims without looking back. I did not watch her go. I remained at my post, motionless, my duty uncompromised by the momentary lapse. But when the crowds had thinned and night had fallen, when my watch had ended and another custodian had taken my place, I returned to find the small book still lying where she had placed it. I collected it, slipping it into a compartment of my armor where it would not be noticed. A breach of protocol. Perhaps the first truly independent action I had taken since my transformation centuries ago. In my private cell, I examined the book. Its pages were yellowed with age, the childish handwriting instantly recognizable as my own despite the centuries that had passed since I had last formed letters with human hands. The stories were simple retellings of imperial propaganda, the sort of tales fed to children to instill loyalty and devotion from the earliest age. Nothing of value from an informational standpoint, nothing that justified the risk I had taken in preserving it. Yet I did not destroy it. Instead, I concealed it in a small cavity behind a loose stone in my cell, a hiding place known only to me, not for frequent review or sentimental visitation, but simply to exist. A tether connecting Epimetheus, the custodian to Derek Vaughn, the child. A reminder that transformation, no matter how complete, always begins with something that existed before. The next day, I reported to Shield Captain, Diocletian, confessing my lapse and surrendering myself for evaluation and potential repurposing. It was the only possible course of action consistent with my nature and training. The book remained hidden, my one small act of defiance in a life defined by perfect obedience. Diocletian listened to my account in silence, his ancient eyes unreadable. When I had finished, he remained quiet for several minutes, considering, you spoke to a civilian who addressed you by your surrendered name, he finally said. You responded to that name. You kept an artifact connected to your former identity. All serious breaches of custodian protocol. Yes, shield captain, I acknowledged. I offer no defense or justification. He studied me, his gaze penetrating, assessing far more than my physical presence. The Emperor spoke to you once, did he not? In the throne room, he called you by that name. I stiffened in surprise, an unprecedented reaction for a custodian. How did you know? Because he has done the same to others over the millennia. rare occurrences separated by centuries but consistent in their pattern a moment of recognition a use of the surrendered name a personal acknowledgment of service diocletian rose moving to a viewing port that overlooked the sprawling expanse of the palace We do not speak of these incidents," he continued. They are not recorded in any official capacity, but they occur nevertheless. The Emperor, in his fragmented consciousness, sometimes reaches out to individual custodians. Why, we cannot say. Perhaps random firings of a damaged mind, perhaps something more purposeful, He turned back to me, his expression grave but not condemning. Your reaction to the woman was a product of that earlier contact. The Emperor's acknowledgement of your surrendered name created a vulnerability, a crack in your conditioning that allowed for this subsequent lapse. It is not a failure of will or dedication on your part, but a consequence of direct, psychic contact with the Master of Mankind." I processed this information, recalibrating my understanding of my own actions and their implications. Am I to be repurposed? I asked, prepared to accept whatever judgment he pronounced. No, said Diocletian. You are to be reassigned. There is a duty for which you are now uniquely suited, precisely because of what has occurred. He activated a hololithic projector, displaying a section of the palace I had never seen before. A circular chamber, its walls lined with what appeared to be thousands of small niches or alcoves. The Menagerie of Identity, he explained. A repository of memories extracted from custodians who have experienced similar contact from the Emperor, a precaution against the very vulnerability you have demonstrated. You will undergo a procedure to remove the specific memories associated with your former identity, including your recent encounter. These memories will be preserved in the menagerie, accessible only to the Captain General and Shield Captains in cases of absolute necessity. The prospect should have brought relief, a return to the pure clarity of purpose that had defined my existence for centuries. Instead, I felt a strange reluctance, a resistance that had no place in a custodian's psychology. The book, I said. What of it? It will be destroyed, of course, replied Diocletian. No physical traces can remain. But the memory of it, like all others connected to your surrendered identity, will be preserved. Nothing truly lost, merely contained where it cannot compromise your function. I nodded, accepting the wisdom and necessity of this course of action. Yet even as I did so, I experienced a sensation entirely new to my transhuman existence, a hollowness, a sense of impending loss that transcended mere logical assessment of advantage and disadvantage. For the first time since my transformation, I faced a future with something approaching regret. The procedure was scheduled for the stained Shilder's concession. The following morning, I returned to my cell to prepare, to meditate, and center myself before this final severance from the lingering ghost of Derek Vaughan. I sat upon the stone floor, closed my eyes, and attempted to achieve the state of focused clarity that had always come so easily before. It eluded me now, my thoughts circling back repeatedly to the hidden book, to the aged face of Sister Helene, to the whispered word from the Golden Throne centuries ago. In the dark hours before dawn, I made a decision that no custodian conditioning could have predicted or prevented. I retrieved the book from its hiding place, handling it with the same precision and care that I would have shown a sacred relic of the Omnisiah. I opened it to the final page, where a child's hand had signed his name in careful, deliberate strokes. Derek Vaughan, Scola Progenium, Terra. I tore the page from the book, folded it carefully, and concealed it within a specialized compartment of my armor, a space designed to hold battlefield stims or emergency medical supplies. The rest of the book I destroyed, shredding its pages and disposing of them through the waste reclamation system that served the custodian barracks. The evidence eliminated. I resumed my meditation, now able to achieve the necessary state of mental preparation for what was to come. When the appointed time arrived, I reported to the Medicaid chamber where the procedure would be performed. Tech priests of a specialized order awaited me there, their robes unmarked, their faces hidden behind featureless masks. Shield Captain Diocletian stood witness, his presence both validation and safeguard, for a process that few outside the custodian order even knew existed. Disarm and disrobe instructed the lead tech priest, his voice a synthetic approximation of human speech. Assume position on the central dais. I complied, removing my armor with practice deficiency, each piece placed precisely upon the designated rack. I retained only the smallest component, a connector node that contained the hidden page, keeping it palmed in my hand as I lay upon the surgical platform at the center of the chamber. Servator arms extended from the ceiling, bearing an array of instruments both familiar and esoteric. A neural interface crown was placed upon my head, its connections finding purchase in ports that had been installed during my original transformation centuries ago. The procedure will extract targeted memory clusters, explained the tech priest, making minute adjustments to various controls. You will experience disorientation and temporary gaps in recall. These will stabilize within approximately 72 hours. Pain will be minimal, as your enhancements provide natural suppression of neural distress signals. I focused on my breathing, on the disciplines that had carried me through far more invasive procedures in the past. The concealed page seemed to burn against my palm, a physical manifestation of my unprecedented act of rebellion. Not against the Emperor, never that, but against the protocols that governed custodian existence, the unyielding structures that defined our service. Initiating memory extraction sequence, announced the tech priest. Subject designation Epimetheus, Confirm Readiness. I am prepared. I responded, my voice steady despite the turmoil that no custodian should have been capable of experiencing. The neural interface activated, sending precise impulses into my cerebral cortex. I felt the boundaries of specific memories becoming fluid, felt the careful separation of neural pathways associated with particular experiences and knowledge. The sensation was not painful, as the tech priest had promised, but it carried a different kind of distress. the awareness of impending absence, the recognition of self being deliberately, surgically diminished. As the procedure progressed, I became aware of a presence in my consciousness, not the clinical precision of the tech priest's instruments, but something warmer, more expansive, a familiar pressure, reminiscent of that moment centuries ago in the throne room, a whisper that was not a sound but a direct impression upon my thoughts. Preserve what matters, Derek von, the voice of the emperor or some fragment of his shattered psyche, a hallucination produced by the neural interface, or merely the desperate projection of a mind facing the excision of its most human components. I could not determine the source, nor did it matter. The message resonated with a truth that transcended its origin. In that moment of clarity, as memories began to slip away like water through cupped hands, I made a decision. I made a final choice. I focused my enhanced will upon a single memory cluster, upon the image of a small book and an aged woman's face. I created a mental fortress around this specific recollection, drawing upon techniques taught to custodians for resisting psychic intrusion. I could not prevent the extraction of the broader context, the full narrative of my origins and recent experiences. But this one fragment, this core of meaning, I shielded with everything my transhuman mind could muster. The procedure concluded, the neural interface powered down, its connections retracting from my skull. The tech priests conducted their final scans, confirming the successful extraction and containment of the targeted memories, shield captain diocletian reviewed their findings his expression revealing nothing of his thoughts or assessment the procedure appears successful he finally pronounced resume your armor and weapons epimetheus report to the chamber of assignment at dawn tomorrow for your new posting I rose from the surgical platform, moving with the fluid grace that characterized all custodian motion despite the lingering disorientation of the procedure. I felt the absence of certain memories could perceive the carefully excised gaps in my recall. Yet the core I had protected remained, a small island of continuity in a sea of surgical alteration. As I redombed my armor, piece by golden piece, I palmed the hidden page once more, returning it to its concealment within the specialized compartment. An act of defiance, of preservation, of simple human stubbornness that should have been bred out of me centuries ago. I could no longer articulate the motivation, could no longer access the full context that would have explained my own actions to myself. I knew only that it mattered, this fragile link to something beyond duty and vigilance. The following dawn, I reported as ordered to the Chamber of Assignment. Shield Captain Diocletian awaited me there, along with a custodian I had never before encountered. This newcomer's armor bore the distinctive markings of the Shadow Keepers, those who guarded the dark cells and their terrible contents." "'Epimetheus,' said Diocletian, "'you are hereby reassigned to the Shadowkeeper's Shield Company effective immediately.' You will serve under shield Captain Navradaran, standing vigil over those threats too dire to destroy, too dangerous to release. I saluted, fist to chest in the traditional custodian gesture of acknowledgement and acceptance. Your unique experiences, continued Diocletian, choosing his words with obvious care, have prepared you for the particular challenges of this assignment. The dark cells contain entities that attack not merely the body but the mind. Your recent procedure has created certain neural pathways that render you more resistant to such incursions. In other words, the very vulnerability that had necessitated the memory extraction now made me valuable for this most sensitive of duties. The irony would have amused me had amusement remained within my emotional repertoire. As it was, I simply accepted the tactical logic of the assignment. You will depart immediately," said Navradarran, speaking for the first time. His voice was deep, resonant with the same timbre that all custodians shared despite individual, variations in pitch and cadence. The journey to the Dark Cells is long and follows paths unknown to most of our brothers. Prepare yourself for a vigil unlike any you have experienced before. I nodded, gathering solemnity from its resting-place against the wall. The guardian spear felt right in my grip, an extension of my purpose and being. Whatever memories had been taken from me, whatever vulnerabilities addressed, I remained Epimetheus, custodian of the Adeptus Custodes. My duty was eternal, my dedication absolute. If I carried a small fragment of something else, some echo of a child long dead, it was safely contained, a secret that would never compromise my function. As I followed Navradaran from the chamber of assignment, shield Captain Diocletian's voice stopped me at the threshold. The Emperor protects Epimetheus. I turned, meeting his ancient gaze. For the briefest moment, I thought I detected something in his expression, some knowledge or understanding that went beyond the formal nature of our interaction. as if he knew precisely what I had done, what I had preserved, and chose not to act upon that knowledge. The Emperor protects, I replied, the formal response carrying perhaps a shadow of deeper meaning. Then I was gone, following my new commander into the depths of the palace, toward a duty that would consume the next several centuries of my immortal vigil. The memories of Derek Vaughn, of Sister Helene, of a small book of childish stories, all officially extracted and contained within the menagerie of identity. All gone from my conscious recall, save for that single protected core, that island of continuity I had fought to preserve. In the millennia that followed, I stood watch over horrors that would have driven lesser beings mad merely to perceive. I fought when fighting was required, killed when killing was necessary, but mostly I stood in perfect vigilant stillness, a golden sentinel before cells that contained entities beyond comprehension. The dark cells were a realm unto themselves, a section of the imperial palace that existed partially outside conventional reality, its corridors twisting in non-Euclidean patterns that confounded even the enhanced spatial awareness of a custodian. Time passed differently here. Centuries compressed into moments of perfect focus, then expanded again into subjective eternities of unbroken vigilance. I witnessed the changing of the guard, the rotation of custodians who served alongside me, their faces becoming familiar, then passing into memory as they were reassigned or, more rarely, fell in combat against escaped prisoners or external threats. Through it all, I maintained my silent vigil, the hidden fragment of memory neither fading nor intruding upon my duties. It simply existed, a small kernel of something other than pure custodian purpose buried deep within my consciousness. On rare occasions, when standing before certain cells containing entities that attacked the mind rather than the body, I would feel that fragment pulse with unexpected strength as if responding to the psychic pressure. In those moments, I understood why Shield Captain Diocletian had assigned me to this duty. The very vulnerability I carried made me stronger against these particular threats, more resilient where other custodians might falter. In my third millennium of service, long after shield Captain Navradarin had fallen in battle against a thousand sons' incursion and been replaced by younger commanders, I was summoned from the dark cells to the chamber of the Captain General himself. This was unprecedented in my experience, a break in routine so significant that it momentarily disrupted the perfect equilibrium of my existence. The journey from the dark cells to the upper levels of the palace took several days, traversing passages so secret that only custodians knew of their existence. When I finally stood before the ornate doors of the Captain General's sanctum, I felt a strange tension, an anticipation that had no place in the perfectly regulated psychology of a custodian. I attributed it to the lingering effects of prolonged exposure to the psychic emanations of the dark cells and dismissed it from conscious consideration. The sanctum was a space of austere grandeur, its walls lined with weapons and armor from across the millennia of custodian history. The Captain General himself stood with his back to me, gazing out a rare viewport that offered a glimpse of Terra's barren surface far below. He was unarmored, wearing only a simple robe of imperial crimson, yet his transhuman physique marked him unmistakably as custodian. When he turned to face me, I recognized him immediately, though we had never met in person. Trajan Valoris, Captain General for nearly a millennium, regarded by many as the greatest leader the custodian guard had seen since the heresy. "'Epimetheus,' he said, his voice carrying the weight of authority without the need for volume or emphasis. "'Your service record is exemplary, three thousand years without incident or failure. Few can claim such consistency, even among our immortal brotherhood. I remained at attention. Guardian Spear held in formal rest position, awaiting whatever pronouncement or assignment was to follow this unexpected commendation.' You are hereby relieved of your duties with the shadowkeepers," continued Valoris. You will be reassigned to my personal guard, effective immediately. This was far more than a simple change of posting." The Captain General's Guard was comprised of the most elite custodians, veterans of countless battles, warriors whose skill and dedication had been proven beyond any possible question. It was an honor almost beyond comprehension, the culmination of millennia of perfect service. I am humbled by your trust, Captain General." I responded, the formal words carrying the full weight of their literal meaning, I will serve with all that I am. Valores nodded, studying me with eyes that had witnessed the slow decline of the Imperium across a thousand years of leadership. there is another matter he said moving to a data terminal embedded in a marble pedestal at the center of the chamber one that concerns you specifically epimetheus or perhaps i should say derrick von the name struck me like a physical blow resonating with that hidden fragment of memory i had preserved through the extraction procedure three millennia ago I maintained my outward composure, but inwardly I experienced a moment of genuine shock, an emotion I had thought long excised from my transhuman psychology. "'You are surprised,' observed Valeris. "'Good.' That confirms what the record suggested. The memory extraction was not entirely successful. He activated the data terminal, projecting a hololithic image between us. A page torn from a small book, its edges yellowed with age, a child's handwriting clearly visible. Derek Vaughan, Scholar Progenium, Terra. This was found secreted within your armor during standard maintenance procedures fifty years ago, said Valores. It has been under investigation since then, along with your complete service history and psychological profile. I said nothing. There was nothing to say. The evidence was irrefutable. The breach of protocol clear. You should have been repurposed immediately, continued Valoris. That would have been the standard procedure. Shield Captain Veritark, who discovered this item, recommended exactly that course of action. I denied his request. This was unexpected. The Captain General himself had intervened to prevent my repurposing. The implications were difficult to process, contradicting everything I understood about custodian protocol and discipline. Do you know why?" asked Valoris, though his tone suggested he did not expect an answer. No, Captain General, I replied truthfully. Valoris deactivated the hololithic projector, the image of the page disappearing from between us. He moved to a weapons rack mounted, and on the far wall, removing an ancient guardian spear. Its design subtly different from those carried by modern custodians. This weapon belonged to Constantine Valdor. he said holding the spear with reverent care the first captain-general the emperor's right hand during the great crusade and the heresy it is said that he alone among all custodians retained full memory of his life before transformation that the emperor specifically ordered his conditioning to be partial rather than complete preserving something of his original identity, even as he was remade into the greatest of our kind. He replaced the weapon in its place of honor, turning back to face me. That detail is not recorded in any official history. It exists only as an oral tradition passed from each Captain General to his successor. I cannot verify its truth, nor its purpose if true, but I have come to believe that it speaks to something essential about our nature and function. He gestured for me to accompany him to the viewport, indicating that I should stand beside him rather than behind. A gesture of equality that was unprecedented in my experience. We are not the Astartes, he said, gazing out at the desolate landscape of terror. We are not mass-produced weapons, forged by the thousand from gene templates and hypno-conditioning. Each custodian is a unique creation, handcrafted through a process that transforms a single child into something beyond human. That specificity, that individuality of creation, is central to what we are and how we function. He turned to look directly at me. His expression grave yet somehow understanding. Complete erasure of identity may not be the ideal outcome of that process. A fragment, carefully preserved and contained, may serve a purpose that the emperor in his wisdom foresaw, even if we cannot fully comprehend it. Your case is not the first of its kind, Epimetheus. merely the most recent in a pattern that stretches back to the earliest days of our order. This revelation was staggering, challenging fundamental assumptions that had defined my existence for three millennia. The possibility that my preservation of that memory fragment had not been an act of defiance or weakness, but rather an unconscious alignment with some deeper purpose, was almost too significant to process in a single moment. the emperor spoke to you once said valoris it was not a question but a statement of fact called you by your surrendered name yes captain general i confirmed during my service in the sanctum imperialis over two millennia ago valoris nodded as if this information confirmed some private theory or expectation There are others scattered throughout our ranks, custodians who have experienced similar contact, who carry similar preserved fragments of their original identities. Not many. Perhaps one in a thousand. But consistent across the millennia, suggesting purpose rather than random occurrence. He returned to the central pedestal, retrieving a small item that he held concealed in his massive hand. Your reassignment to my personal guard is not merely an honor or recognition of service," he continued. It is a practical necessity. The coming millennium will bring challenges unprecedented in imperial history. The Sycatrix maledictum grows wider. The enemies of mankind grow bolder. We custodians must adapt if we are to fulfill our sacred duty of protecting the Emperor. He opened his hand, revealing the torn page I had hidden within my armor fifty years ago. Not a hololithic projection this time, but the actual physical item preserved despite its age and fragility. This belongs to you, he said, offering it to me. Not to Epimetheus the custodian, perhaps, but to something deeper, more fundamental within you, something the Emperor himself recognized and acknowledged. I return it now, not as contraband to be hidden, but as a sanctioned element of your identity. A reminder that even in transformation, something essential remains. I accepted the page with steady hands, experiencing a complex emotional response that my custodian conditioning had neither anticipated nor prepared me for. not joy, not relief, but a kind of recognition, an acknowledgement of wholeness that transcended the artificial divisions between past and present, between human and transhuman. You will not be memory-wiped again, said Valores, nor will you discuss this matter with any save myself or my designated successors. This aspect of certain custodians' nature remains a closely guarded secret known only to those who need to know. the wider imperium is not ready to understand the full complexity of what we are what the emperor designed us to be he placed a hand on my shoulder the gesture both formal and somehow personal in a way that defied easy categorization guard this knowledge as carefully as you guard the emperor himself epimetheus It is perhaps equally valuable, equally essential to humanity's survival in the dark millennium that lies ahead. I returned to my quarters that night with the page secured once more within my armor, this time with the explicit sanction of the Captain General himself. As I prepared for my new duties, meditating upon the profound implications of everything Valoris had revealed, I felt that preserved fragment of memory stirring within me, no longer confined to the deepest recesses of my consciousness, but integrated more fully into my awareness. I remembered Sister Helene more clearly now, her kindness in the harsh environment of the scola progenium. I remembered the small book of stories, painstakingly written in a child's careful hand. I remembered the moment of my selection, the mixture of pride and fear that had accompanied my departure from everything familiar. These memories did not weaken my resolve or distract from my purpose as a custodian. If anything, they provided context, dimension, a foundation upon which my transhuman identity had been, constructed rather than a contradiction of it. In the centuries that followed, I served in the Captain General's Guard with the same unwavering dedication that had characterized my previous postings. I fought in the Battle of Lyons Gate, stood vigil during the Terran Crusade, witnessed the return of the Primark-Rabute Giliman and the subsequent reorganization of imperial defenses. Through it all, I remained Epimetheus, custodian of the Adeptus Custodes, guardian of the Emperor and his realm. Yet I was also, in some small but significant way, still Derek Vaughan. Not in opposition to my custodian identity, but as an integral part of it, a core of continuity that stretched back to a child selected for transformation, a foundation upon which everything else had been built. this understanding did not compromise my duty but enriched it providing a perspective that pure conditioning alone could not create on rare occasions during the most sacred and solemn rituals of the custodian order i would catch valores watching me with an expression of thoughtful assessment not suspicion or concern but a kind of validation as if my continued excellence of service confirmed some theory he had long held about the nature of our kind we never spoke directly of the matter again the subject too sensitive for casual discussion but there existed between us an unspoken understanding a shared awareness of complexities in the custodian condition that few others recognized or acknowledged In my four-thousandth year of service, during a rare moment of solitude in the Hall of Remembrance, where the names of fallen custodians were inscribed upon walls of golden marble, I experienced something unprecedented. A moment of genuine, unprompted emotion. Not the muted acknowledgement of duty fulfilled, or the abstract appreciation of tactical success, but something deeper, more fundamentally human. Gratitude. gratitude for the fragment preserved for the continuity maintained across millennia of transformation and service gratitude for the wisdom of Valores in recognizing its value rather than condemning it as weakness gratitude perhaps most profoundly to the Emperor himself who in his infinite foresight had designed the custodians not as perfect unfeeling automatons but as beings of impossible complexity carrying within us elements of our original humanity, alongside our transhuman capabilities. I understood then the truth of what it means to be custodian, not merely to be transformed, to surrender identity and purpose to a higher cause, but to become something that transcends both human limitations and transhuman coldness. To exist in a space between, carrying the strengths of both while being confined by the weaknesses of neither, to be simultaneously epimetheus the immortal guardian and derek von the mortal child both and neither a synthesis beyond simple categorization that is what it truly means to be recruited into the adeptus custodians not merely to be chosen and remade but to be preserved in transformation to die and live simultaneously becoming something the emperor in his wisdom knew humanity would need in its darkest hours not unfeeling sentinels but conscious guardians, carrying within us the very essence of what we were sworn to protect. I am epimetheus of the Adeptus custodies, guardian of the emperor of mankind. I stand eternal vigil, golden and perfect, an immortal protector crafted by processes beyond comprehension. My dedication is absolute, my purpose unwavering, my service without end. And somewhere, deep within, I am still Derek Vaughan, a child of terror selected for transformation, preserved in transfiguration. The memory of that child does not weaken me. It anchors me. reminds me of what I protect and why protection matters. In the synthesis of these two truths lies the ultimate secret of the Adeptus Custodes, a truth known only to the Emperor himself and those few he chooses to share it with. We are not merely his guardians. We are his memory of what humanity once was, and his vision of what it might yet become, In each of us, he preserves a fragment of the species we are sworn to protect. Not as weakness, but as purpose. Not as contradiction, but as completion. I will stand my vigil until the stars grow cold or the emperor rises. I will fulfill my duty without hesitation or compromise. I am custodian, golden and immortal, perfect in form and function, and I am human, preserved in remembrance, anchored in continuity. Both truths eternal, both essential. Both the gift and the burden of being chosen for the greatest transformation the Imperium can bestow. This is what it means to be recruited into the Adeptus custodies, to lose everything, and in that loss, to preserve what matters most.

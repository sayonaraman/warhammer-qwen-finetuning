I was once a child. This fact alone surprises me when I permit myself to consider it. Not that I recall anything of that time. Such memories were scoured from me, scraped away like tarnish from silver. But logic dictates I must have been born, must have drawn breath as something small and weak before I became what I am now. Brother Captain Malric Vane of the Third Brotherhood, Grey Knight of the Ordo Malleus, a weapon forged for a single purpose. The Fortress Monastery of Titan hangs in perpetual orbit around Saturn, hidden behind layers of void shields and psychic wards that render it invisible to all but those who already know of its existence. I stand now at the edge of the training grounds, watching initiates spar with force halberds. Their movements are precise, mechanical, each blow calculated to sever limbs or pierce vital organs, They show no joy in victory, no frustration in defeat. They are being remade, as I was remade. Some nights, I dream of a woman with amber eyes. Her face is always indistinct, features blurred as if viewed through frosted glass, yet those eyes remain sharp in my mind. I cannot say if she was my mother, or perhaps merely a fragment of someone I encountered before the trials. It matters not. Such thoughts are dangerous, potentially corrupting. I purge them with ritual and prayer, with pain willingly embraced as cleansing fire. The Grey Knights are the Emperor's final sanction against the most terrible enemy mankind has ever faced. Where Daemon's walk, we follow. Where the warp spills its filth into reality, we stand against the tide. Our existence is not merely secret, it is a void, a negative space in imperial records. Even among those few who know of us, fewer still understand what we truly are. We are not heroes. Heroes are celebrated, remembered, their deeds carved into monuments that outlast their mortal spans. We are sentinels who stand eternal watch over an abyss that would consume all humanity, and when we fall, as all must. Eventually fall, we are erased. No monuments, no remembrance, only silence. I have served for 342 Terran years. In that time, I have witnessed horrors that would shatter the minds of lesser men. I have communed with the souls of my fallen brothers, their essence preserved in the Librarious Aegis. I have slaughtered loyal imperial citizens whose only crime was bearing witness to our existence, and I have never once questioned my duty. Until now, it began with a distress call from the shrine world of piety's end. A remote planet in the Ultima Segmentum, significant only for housing the remains of Saint Drusella, a martyred sister of the Adepta Sororitas, who died cleansing a Xenos infestation three millennia ago. The astropathic message was fragmented, corrupted, but clear enough in its desperation. Something had awakened on Piety's end, something old, something hungry. The prognosticars had foreseen this, Three of their number had perished in the divining. Their bodies reduced to withered husks as they strained to pierce the veil of the future. What they saw was sufficient to deploy a strike force. Five squads, Twenty-five battle brothers, led by myself. Twenty-five souls against the darkness. It would have to be enough. The journey through the warp was troubled. Navigator Helius reported strange currents, eddies in the immaterial that pulled at our vessel like hungry mouths. Twice we were forced to drop back into real space to reorient ourselves. Twice I ordered the Battle Brothers to undergo the rites of cleansing, though we had encountered no direct taint. One cannot be too cautious when traversing the realm of daemons. On the eighteenth day of transit, Brother Galen approached me in the ship's chapel. He knelt before the altar, his armor removed for the ritual hour of vulnerability we observe each ship cycle. Without his Aegis suit, the modifications to his body were plainly visible. The reinforced ribcage that housed his secondary heart. The neural ports at the base of his skull that allowed communion with his armor, The pale skin stretched taut over enhanced musculature, marked with silver script of wards and prayers. Captain, he said, his voice soft despite the augmentation of his vocal cords. I have been troubled by visions. I nodded for him to continue. Among the gray knights, psychic potential is not merely common but mandatory. All of us can touch the warp to some degree, channel its energies through the filter of our discipline. But this gift comes with dangers, even for those as rigorously trained as we are. I see a city of bone," Galen continued. Its spires reach toward a sky the color of a bruise. And beneath it, something pulses, something that has no name in any human tongue. I placed my hand on his shoulder, feeling the coiled tension in his enhanced frame. Have you performed the hexagramic wards? The litany of mental fortress. Yes, brother Captain. They provide no relief. I considered this. Galen was young by our standards, barely a century of service to his name, but he had proven himself repeatedly in combat against the Neverborn. His mind was strong, his faith unquestioning. If he was experiencing visions that resisted our standard protections, it warranted concern. Tell no one else. I instructed him. When we reach piety's end, you will remain at my side at all times. If these visions intensify, you will inform me immediately. And if I become compromised. The question hung between us, its answer unspoken but understood. If Galen showed signs of corruption, I would execute him myself. A mercy. Compared to the alternatives, "'Trust in your training, brother,' I said instead. "'Trust in the emperor's protection.' He nodded and returned to his prayers. I left him there, surrounded by guttering candles and the scent of sacred incense, his lips moving in silent devotion. I did not tell him that I too had dreamed of a city of bone, its towers reaching toward a sickly sky. Some burdens a captain must bear alone." Three days later, we translated back into real space at the edge of the Piety's End system. The planet hung before us, a blue-green jewel against the void. From orbit, it appeared untouched, peaceful even. The continental masses were largely covered in vast forests, with a single major ocean covering the southern hemisphere. The capital city, Martirium, was visible as a cluster of lights on the northern continent surrounding the great cathedral that housed St. Drusella's remains. There was no sign of distress, no void battles, no atmospheric disturbances that might indicate large-scale conflict. The orbital defense platforms maintained their silent vigil, powered but dormant. By all appearances, Piety's end was exactly as it should be. A peaceful shrine world honoring its patron saint. Establish communication with the planetary governor I ordered the ship's communication officer, a mortal man who had been mind-scrubbed to allow his service alongside our order. Several minutes passed. The officer's hands moved over his console, his expression growing increasingly troubled. No response, brother captain. I am attempting to contact the PDF headquarters, the Ecclesiarchy mission, and the Administratum offices. All channels are silent. I exchanged glances with brother librarian Thaddeus, our squad's psychic specialist. His expression remained impassive, but I could sense his disquiet. Scan for life signs, I commanded. The results were perplexing. The Augur arrays detected approximately three million human life signatures, consistent with the planet's recorded population. their distribution matched expected patterns concentrated around martyrium with smaller clusters representing outlying settlements they appear to be alive the officer reported but there is something strange about the readings the life signs are static unchanged as if they are all in exactly the same state sleeping suggested thaddeus No, my lord. Even in sleep, human vital signs fluctuate. These readings show no variation at all. It is as if—the officer hesitated. Speak freely, I said. It is as if they are all frozen in a single moment, my lord. I made my decision. Prepare for planetary insertion, full combat protocol. Squad purgation will secure the landing zone. Squad's interceptor, purifier, and strike will establish a perimeter around the cathedral. Squad Terminator will accompany me directly to the Governor's Palace. As the Battle Brothers moved to their designated positions, Brother Galen approached me once more. His face was ashen, his eyes sunken. The city of bone, he whispered. It is here. Beneath our feet. I clasped his forearm, the traditional warrior's grip of our chapter. Stand fast, brother. Whatever awaits us, we face it together." He nodded, but his eyes remained distant, seeing things invisible to others. I made a mental note to have Thaddeus monitor him during the descent. If Galen's visions were intensifying as we approached the planet, it suggested a powerful psychic presence below, one that could reach out and touch even the shielded minds of the gray knights. The drop pods screamed through the atmosphere, trailing fire against the darkening sky. Night was falling on Martirium as we descended, the shadows lengthening across the city streets. From my position in the lead pod, I could see the great cathedral rising above the surrounding buildings, its spires piercing the low clouds. The governor's palace stood adjacent to it, a sprawling complex of marble and gold that spoke more of vanity than governance." We landed with bone-jarring force in the palace's central courtyard, the drop pod's doors blasting outward to allow immediate deployment. I was first to exit, storm-bolter raised, scanning for threats. The courtyard was empty, fountains played, sending arcs of water into ornamental pools, Carefully tended gardens bloomed with flowers that released their scent into the evening air. And everywhere there were statues. Hundreds of them positioned throughout the courtyard in various poses. Some appeared to be palace staff, frozen in the midst of their duties. Others were clearly members of the PDF, weapons half-raised as if responding to an alarm, All were rendered in exquisite detail, their expressions caught in a moment of dawning horror. Brother Octavius, our squad's most experienced veteran, approached one of the statues and ran an armored finger across its surface. Stone, he confirmed, not merely covered in it, transformed into it. I accessed the tactical network, connecting with the other squad leaders. Squad Purgation in position, came the first response. Landing zone secure. We are encountering the same phenomenon. Civilians transformed to stone. Squad interceptor moving toward the cathedral. Streets filled with stone figures. No signs of conflict, no boulder marks, no evidence of blades or conventional weapons. Squad purifier at the eastern perimeter. We are detecting faint warp signatures emanating from the cathedral. Nothing immediately hostile, but present. Squad Strike holding the Western approach. Be advised, the stone figures are not merely random. They appear to be arranged in patterns when viewed from above. I processed this information trying to form a coherent picture of what had occurred. A psychic attack, powerful enough to instantly petrify an entire population, was beyond even the capabilities of most greater daemons. Yet there had been no reports of warp storms, no signs of ritual or summoning. Advance on the palace interior, I ordered my squad. Maintain psychic wards at maximum. Brother Thaddeus, remain alert for any fluctuations in the Imperian. We moved in tight formation through the palace doors, our Terminator armor allowing for surprising agility despite its bulk. The entrance hall was grand, with a vaulted ceiling supported by columns of imported marble. More statues lined our path, nobles and officials caught in moments of terrified realization. Brother Galen suddenly staggered, his storm-bolter dipping toward the floor as he raised a hand to his helm. Captain, he voxed on a private channel. The visions are stronger here. I can see the city of bones superimposed over this place, like two realities occupying the same space. Can you continue?" I asked, already knowing his answer. I am a gray knight, he replied simply. I will endure. We pressed on, moving deeper into the palace. The governor's throne room lay ahead, its massive doors standing open in silent invitation. As we approached, I sensed something wrong. A subtle distortion in the air, like heat rising from sun-baked stone. Hold, I commanded, raising my fist. The squad stopped instantly, weapons trained on the doorway. Brother Thaddeus stepped forward, his psychic hood glowing faintly as he extended his senses. There is a presence beyond, he reported. Ancient. Patient. It waits for us. I considered our options. Standard protocol when facing unknown warp entities was to establish a containment perimeter and summon additional forces. but the population of piety's end was already lost transformed to stone by whatever power lurked within the palace and if we retreated there was no guarantee that this entity would remain confined to this world brother thadius prepare the rites of banishment i ordered the rest of you purification protocol we go in together As one, we checked our weapons. Stormbolters loaded with blessed silver ammunition, force weapons charged with psychic energy, grenades sanctified in the fires of Titans' forges. Each battle brother activated the specialized systems integrated into their Terminator armor. Teleport homers, psychic amplifiers, personal force fields. I drew my sword, the blade igniting with blue-white fire as my mind connected with the weapon's spirit. Three hundred years we had fought together, this blade and I. It, had tasted the icor of a thousand daemons, had severed the limbs of greater Neverborn and banished them howling back to the warp. Now it would face another test. For the Emperor, I intoned, and for the honor of our chapter. We are the Hammer, responded my battle-brothers in unison. With that, we crossed the threshold into the Governor's throne room, prepared for battle against the unknown horror that awaited us. What we found instead was silence and emptiness. The vast chamber contained only more statues, arranged in concentric circles around the Governor's throne. The governor himself was there, transformed to stone like his subjects, his face locked in an expression of supplication. He knelt before his own throne, arms outstretched as if begging for mercy. But the throne was not empty. Upon it sat a figure that at first glance appeared to be another statue, but this one was different. Rather than the gray stone of the transformed humans, this figure was carved from what appeared to be pure obsidian, black and glossy, reflecting the dim light of the chamber. It had the form of a robed woman, her features serene, almost beautiful in their perfect symmetry. Brothers Octavius and Galen, secure the perimeter, I ordered quietly. Brother Thaddeus, Analysis. Thaddeus approached the throne cautiously, his psychic hood flaring brighter as he drew near. It is a vessel, he said after a moment. A container for something far larger than what we perceive. As if in response to his words, the obsidian figure's eyes opened. They contained no pupils, no iris, merely pools of absolute darkness that seemed to draw in light rather than reflect it. The Grey Knights. The figure spoke, its voice like the whisper of stone grinding against stone. The emperor's secret weapon against the denizens of the warp. How fascinating that you would come here, to my humble gathering. I raised my sword, its psychic fire casting blue shadows across the chamber. Identify yourself, creature. A smile curved the obsidian lips, a gesture as cold and empty as the void. I have had many names across the millennia. The architects of the Nephilim Citadel called me ATH Tagul. The pre-human societies of this world knew me as the Whisperer in stone. But names are such limiting things, are they not, brother Captain Malric Vane? It knew my name. This was not surprising, merely confirming that we faced an entity of significant power. Many of the Neverborn could pluck such information from the Aether, especially when dealing with individuals as psychically active as Grey Knights. You have committed atrocities against the people of this world," I stated flatly. In the name of the Emperor and the authority of the Ordo Malleus, I sentence you to banishment. The figure laughed. A sound like avalanches in distant mountains. Atrocities? I have merely preserved them. Look around you, Malric Vane. See how perfect they have become. Unchanging. Eternal. Free from fear. From pain. from the ravages of time. Is this not a mercy? It is abomination, I replied, signaling to my squad to begin moving into banishment formation. And it ends now. The obsidian figure tilted its head, studying me with those lightless eyes. You disappoint me, Grey Knight. I had hoped for understanding from your kind, if from no others. After all, are we not similar in our goals? Both of us seek to preserve humanity from change. We are nothing alike, I growled, feeling my anger rise despite centuries of training to suppress such emotions. We protect humanity. You corrupt and destroy it. Protection, destruction, such limited concepts. The figure rose from the throne, its movements fluid despite its apparent stone composition. What do you think happens to a soul when its body is transformed to stone, grey knight? Where does it go? I will show you. With a gesture from the obsidian figure, the stone statues surrounding us began to glow with a faint inner light. It was subtle at first, barely perceptible, but growing steadily brighter. And with the light came sound, a distant chorus of voices, millions strong, all singing the same wordless note of perfect, endless harmony. Brother Galen fell to his knees, his weapon clattering to the floor. The city of bone, he gasped. I can see it clearly now. It is not built of bone. It is built of souls. Precisely, said the obsidian figure, sounding pleased, every soul I have taken preserved in eternal contemplation. A perfect city beyond time, beyond corruption. Even your precious emperor cannot offer such permanence. I had heard enough. With a thought, I activated the teleport Homer attached to my armor, signaling the strike cruiser in orbit. Brothers, fall back. Purge protocol authorized. The obsidian figure's expression changed, the serene smile fading. You would destroy this world. Obliterate all I have preserved? For what purpose, Grey Knight? To satisfy your narrow definition of what humanity should be? I did not bother to respond to the creature's questions. Instead, I launched myself forward, force sword raised, the blade connected with the obsidian form, psychic fire meeting ancient stone. There was resistance, far more than there should have been, as if I were trying to cut through the heart of a mountain. The figure raised its hand, and an invisible force threw me backward. I crashed into one of the stone courtiers, shattering it to dust. Disappointing, the figure said. I offered transcendence, and you answer with violence. So be it. The air in the chamber began to shimmer, reality thinning as the creature drew upon warp energies. The stone statues throughout the room started to crack, fissures appearing in their perfect surfaces. But rather than crumbling, they began to move. jerky, unnatural movements, like puppets controlled by an unskilled hand. Brother Captain, voxed Thaddeus urgently. It is animating the transformed citizens. I am detecting warp signatures flowing into the stone forms. Maintain banishment protocol, I ordered, regaining my feet. Target the obsidian figure. All force weapons at full capacity. My squad responded immediately. centuries of training overcoming any shock at facing animated stone constructs. Storm-bolters roared, silver-tipped rounds shattering the approaching stone figures. But for each one destroyed, three more entered from adjoining chambers, an endless supply of puppet soldiers for the entity to command. Brother Octavius reached the obsidian figure first, his halberd sweeping in a devastating arc. The creature caught the weapon with one hand, stopping its momentum instantly. With its other hand, it touched Octavius' chest plate. Where its fingers made contact, the blessed Terminator armor began to transform, Ceramite becoming stone that spread rapidly across the surface. "'Brother!' I shouted, leaping forward to aid him. But I was too late. The petrification reached Octavius's helmet, freezing him in a pose of defiance, halberd still clutched in stone hands. Rage filled me, a dangerous emotion for any Scyca but especially for a gray knight. I channeled it into my sword, the blade's psychic fire intensifying until it burned white hot. With a wordless battle cry, I swung at the creature's midsection. This time, the blade bit deep. The obsidian cracked, dark energies spilling from the wound like blood. The creature's face contorted in what appeared to be genuine surprise. Impossible, it hissed. No mortal weapon should harm this form. This is no mere mortal weapon, I replied, twisting the blade. This is the Emperor's wrath made manifest. The creature's response was to unleash a pulse of energy that sent all of us staggering backward. The stone soldiers closed in, grasping at our armor with unyielding hands. Through the tactical network, I could hear reports from the other squads. They too were under attack from animated statues, hundreds of them converging on our positions. Brother Captain, Vox, the leader of Squad Purifier, the warp signature at the cathedral is intensifying. We believe it may be the source of the entity's power. This confirmed my suspicions. The creature before us, powerful as it was, served as a focal point for something larger. Perhaps it was drawing power from the warp tear within the cathedral, using the sacred site as a means to anchor itself in real space. Brother Thaddeus, I called." Can you disrupt the connection between this creature and the cathedral?" Thaddeus was already at work, his hands weaving complex patterns as he chanted in forbidden tongues. Languages so dangerous that merely hearing them could drive an untrained mind to madness. But we were gray knights. Such risks were our daily bread. I can create a temporary severance, Thaddeus replied. But I will need time. "'Brothers, Marius and Septimus, protect Thaddeus,' I ordered. "'The rest of you with me.' We must keep this abomination occupied. We formed a protective circle around Thaddeus, our storm-bolters clearing swathes through the animated statues. But they were numberless. The entire population of a world turned against us. And the obsidian figure had recovered from my attack, the crack in its form already sealing itself. Your resistance is futile." The creature said. Even now, the process continues throughout this world. Soon, every living thing on Piety's end will join my collection. And then, when the alignment is complete, I shall extend my gift to other worlds. What alignment! I demanded, more to keep the creature talking than out of genuine curiosity. Every moment it spent in conversation was another moment for Thaddeus to complete his ritual. The obsidian figure gestured upward, though the ceiling blocked any view of the sky. This world orbits through a nexus of reality once every three thousand years, a place where the veil between dimensions thins to nothing. The humans built their cathedral here because they sensed the very power of this place, though they did not understand its true nature. They worshipped their saint Drusella, never realizing that it was I who whispered to them from beneath the stones. As it spoke, I noticed something disturbing. The stone soldiers nearest to the obsidian figure were changing. The rough, gray stone of their bodies was darkening, taking on the same glossy black appearance as the creature itself. They moved more smoothly as well, their jerky motions becoming fluid, purposeful. It is converting them, I voxed to my squad. The petrification was only the first stage. Brother Galen, who had recovered enough to rejoin the battle, moved to my side. Captain, I can see the process in the immaterial. It is not merely transforming their bodies, it is rewriting their very souls, binding them to itself. This was worse than I had feared. Not simple destruction or corruption, but a fundamental alteration of the human soul. If such a process could be extended beyond this world, the implications were catastrophic. Brother Thaddeus, I called, status. Almost complete, brother Captain," Thaddeus replied. His voice strained with effort. But I am encountering resistance. The creature has safeguards I did not anticipate. The obsidian figure turned its attention to Thaddeus, seeming to notice his efforts for the first time. Ah, a librarian, it said, attempting to sever my connection to the cathedral. Clever but inadequate. It raised a hand toward Thaddeus, dark energy gathering at its fingertips. I intercepted the attack, my sword cleaving through the energy bolt, dispersing it into harmless sparks. The backlash staggered me, my armor's systems momentarily overloaded by the conflicting energies. Now, Thaddeus! I shouted, sensing that the creature was preparing a second, more powerful attack. Thaddeus completed his incantation with a final desperate syllable, The effect was immediate and violent. A psychic shockwave erupted from his position, rippling, outward through the chamber. Where it passed, the animated statues collapsed, returning to lifeless stone. The obsidian figure itself screamed, a sound so profoundly wrong that it caused warning runes to flash across my armor's display. The connection is severed, Thaddeus reported, swaying slightly from the effort, But it is temporary, minutes at most. I did not waste the opportunity. All squads converge on the Cathedral. I ordered through the tactical network. Prepare for Phase II deployment. To the creature which was still reeling from Thaddeus' attack. I said, your time on this world ends now, never-born. The obsidian figure straightened, its form flickering slightly as it struggled to maintain cohesion without its connection to the Cathedral. You understand nothing, Grey Knight. I am not of the warp as you conceive it. I am far older, from a time before your species crawled from the primordial ooze of your homeworld. I have watched civilizations rise and fall. I will watch yours do the same. Not from here. You will not." I replied. With a thought, I activated the teleport beacon integrated into my armor. The familiar sensation of displacement washed over me as the ship's teleportarium locked onto our signals. In an instant, we were gone from the throne room, molecules scattered and reassembled on the teleportation platform of our strike cruiser. Prepare for immediate teleport to the cathedral coordinates. I ordered the teleportarium technicians, full squad deployment, and initiate phase two protocols. Phase two was rarely implemented, reserved for situations where corruption had spread too far for conventional purging. It involved the deployment of cyclonic torpedoes, world killers capable of rendering a planet's surface uninhabitable. Such measures were not taken lightly, even by the Grey Knights. As the Teleportarium recharged for our jump to the Cathedral, I took a moment to assess my squad. Brother Octavius was lost, transformed to stone, by the creature's touch. The others showed varying degrees of damage to their armor, but all remained combat effective. Brother Galen appeared to have recovered from his psychic distress, though his eyes still held a haunted look that concerned me. Brother Galen, I said, moving to his side. Are you fit for continued deployment? He straightened, determination visible in every line of his posture. Yes, brother Captain. The severance of the creature's connection has reduced the visions. I can function. I nodded, satisfied for the moment. The creature called itself Arth Tahul. Does that name appear in any of our records? brother thaddeus who had access to more of the chapter's forbidden law than most shook his head no brother captain but its claim to predate humanity is consistent with certain ancient entities we have encountered the yuvath were known to worship stone constructs of similar description This was troubling. The Yuvath had been a powerful Xeno civilization, psychically gifted and utterly hostile to human life. They had been purged during the Great Crusade, but their artifacts and gods might well have survived in the hidden corners of the galaxy. The teleportarium is ready, brother Captain, announced the chief technician. I addressed my squad one final time before deployment. Brothers, we face an entity of unknown origin and considerable power. Our mission is to reach the heart of the cathedral and destroy whatever warp artifact or portal is sustaining its presence on this world. Once that is accomplished, we withdraw immediately for orbital bombardment. Is that understood? Understood Brother Captain, they replied in unison. Then let us bring the Emperor's justice to this abomination. Once more, the teleportarium activated, its energies surrounding us in a halo of blue-white light. Reality shifted, stretched, and reassembled itself around us. We materialized in the central nave of St. Drusella's Cathedral, a space vast enough to accommodate thousands of worshipers. Massive columns supported a ceiling adorned with frescoes depicting the saints' life and martyrdom. Stained glass windows cast multicolored light across the marble floor, And everywhere, stone figures, priests frozen in mid-sermon, pilgrims caught in acts of devotion, choir servitors silenced in eternal song. But these were not attacking us as the ones in the palace had done. Instead, they stood immobile, their stone eyes seemingly fixed on the altar at the far end of the nave. There, a great reliquary of gold and crystal contained what appeared to be the preserved remains of Saint Drusella herself. but something was wrong with the reliquary. The crystal was clouded, its surface covered in a network of black veins that pulsed with unnatural rhythm. And within, where the saint's remains should have been, there was only a swirling darkness, like a miniature storm-cloud trapped in glass. The focal point, observed Thaddeus, the creature has replaced the saint's remains with a warp conduit. Can we destroy it? I asked. Thaddeus' expression was grim behind his helmet's faceplate. With sufficient force, yes. But doing so will release a tremendous amount of warp energy. The backlash could be... unpredictable. That was Thaddeus' way of saying it could kill us all. But such risks were part of our duty as gray knights. Squads, purgation and strike, establish a perimeter. I ordered through the tactical network... Squad's interceptor and purifier prepare to assist with containing the energy release. My squad will approach the reliquary. We advanced cautiously down the central aisle of the cathedral, weapons ready. The stillness was unnerving. No movement from the stone figures, no sign of the obsidian creature. Only silence, broken by the measured tread of our armored boots on marble. As we neared the altar, I felt a familiar pressure building in my mind, the same sensation I experienced when in proximity to powerful warp, entities, a psychic weight pressing against my mental shields, searching for weaknesses. Be alert, I warned my squad. the creature may attempt psychic infiltration no sooner had i spoken than brother galen gasped staggering slightly captain he said his voice tight with strain it is trying to show me something trying to make me see resist brother i urged him focus on your training the litanies of mental fortitude Galen nodded, visibly centering himself. But I could tell, the assault on his mind was intensifying. Whatever connection had been established between him and the entity during our warp transit, it was being exploited now. We reached the altar steps. The reliquary loomed before us, the darkness within it seeming to watch us with malevolent awareness. I raised my force sword, preparing to strike at the corrupted vessel. Wait, said Brother Thaddeus suddenly." There is something else here. Something beneath the altar. I paused, sensing he was right. There was a presence below us, a psychic signature distinct from the warp energies swirling within the reliquary. Older, colder. Patient. The creature said it, whispered to the humans from beneath the stones, I recalled. This cathedral was built on a place of power. A nexus. Then the reliquary is merely a focus, reasoned Thaddeus. the true entity remains below i made a swift decision change of plans we need to access whatever lies beneath this altar brother marius prepare melter charges as marius moved to comply the air around the reliquary began to shimmer The darkness within it coalesced, taking shape, pressing against the crystal walls of its container. Cracks appeared in the ancient glass, spider webbing across its surface. It is attempting to manifest, warned Thaddeus. Too late. The reliquary shattered in an explosion of glass and corrupted warp energy. The darkness that had been contained within it surged upward, forming a towering column that reached to the cathedral ceiling. Within the column, shapes moved, faces pressed outward, mouths open in silent screams. Thousands of them, perhaps millions, all trapped within the swirling darkness. The souls of piety's end, breathed Galen. The souls of Piety's end. it has harvested them all. From the heart of that swirling column a voice spoke, not with sound, but directly into our minds, bypassing our psychic defenses as if they were not there. You see now the futility of your actions. Gray Knights. It said, These souls are mine. This world is mine. Soon your souls shall join my collection. The pressure against my mental shields intensified, probing for weaknesses. Images flash through my mind. The amber-eyed woman from my dreams. A child running through fields of golden grain. A hand reaching out to me, offering comfort or salvation. False memories, implanted by the creature to distract me, to weaken my resolve. I forced them aside, focusing on my training, on the litanies of protection I had recited daily for centuries. Brothers, I voxed, maintain mental discipline. These visions are not real. Brother Marius had finished placing the melter charges around the altar's base. Charges set, brother captain, he reported. Awaiting your command, all squads. Fall back to defensive positions. I ordered through the tactical network. Prepare for detonation. As my brothers moved to comply, the column of darkness surged forward, tendrils of warp energy lashing out like whips. Where they touched the stone figures throughout the cathedral, the petrified humans began to change, their forms rippling as they were absorbed into the growing mass of darkness. It is consuming them, observed Thaddeus, adding their essence to itself. Detonation in three, I counted down, my thumb hovering over the activation rune. Two, one, the melter charges detonated with a roar of superheated air, vaporizing the altar and blasting a crater in the cathedral floor. Through the smoke and debris, I could see a stairway revealed beneath, descending into darkness. Ancient steps, worn smooth by the passage of countless feet over millennia. The column of darkness recoiled from the explosion, momentarily disrupted. I seized the opportunity. Squads, purifier and strike contain that entity, I ordered. The rest of you, with me. We are going below. Without waiting for acknowledgement, I plunged down the revealed stairway, my armor's auto-senses adjusting to the gloom. The steps descended in a tight spiral, delving deep beneath the cathedral foundations. The walls were not of human construction. They were too smooth, too perfect in their geometry, and they were covered in symbols that hurt the eye to look upon, glyphs that seemed to shift and change when not directly observed. Pre-human construction, noted Thaddeus as he followed close behind me, consistent with the entity's claims of antiquity. These symbols, said Brother Galen, who had insisted on joining the descent despite my concerns about his mental state. I recognize them from my visions. They are a language of sorts, a record of transformation. I did not ask how he knew this. The connection between Galen and the entity was clearly stronger than I had initially assessed. This made him both a vulnerability and potentially our greatest asset in understanding what we faced. The stairway ended in a vast spherical chamber carved from solid bedrock. But the rock had been altered, transmuted into a substance that resembled polished obsidian, the same material as the creature's manifestation in the governor's palace. The chamber was illuminated by a soft, pulsing light that seemed to emanate from the walls themselves, and at the center of the chamber stood a structure that defied easy description. It appeared to be a city in miniature, its towers and spires crafted from a material that resembled bone but was not. The structure rotated slowly, floating several feet above the chamber floor, suspended by no visible means. The city of bone, whispered Galen, just as I saw it. I approached cautiously, my force soared at the ready. As I drew nearer to the floating structure, I began to perceive details that were not immediately apparent. The buildings were not buildings at all, but intricately carved representations of human forms. Thousands of them fused together to create the semblance of architecture. Their faces were contorted in expressions of rapture or agony, often both simultaneously. What is this abomination? I demanded aloud, knowing the entity could hear me. In response, the air before the floating city shimmered, coalescing into the obsidian figure we had encountered in the palace. but it was changed now, more solid, more present. Its formerly smooth surface was now etched with the same shifting symbols that adorned the chamber walls. This is salvation, gray knight, the figure replied. A perfect preservation of consciousness, free from the corruption of flesh, free from the ravages of time and entropy. Each soul captured at the moment of its transcendence, locked forever in a state of perfect understanding. You mean imprisoned, I I countered. Stripped of will, of choice, of humanity. The figure's featureless eyes regarded me with what might have been pity. Choice is an illusion, Malric Vane. You of all humans should understand this. Was choice offered to you when the gray knights took you as a child? When they scoured your mind of all that you were? When they remade you into their weapon? The words struck closer to home than I cared to admit. It was true that I had not chosen my fate. No gray knight had. We were selected, taken, transformed. Our previous lives erased so thoroughly that not even hypnotherapy could recover them. We were weapons, forged for a single purpose. But there was a crucial difference. We serve willingly, I said, knowing the necessity of our sacrifice. These people had no choice, no understanding of what was being done to them. And what of those you execute after your missions? the entity asked. The loyal imperial citizens whose only crime is having witnessed your existence. Do they choose their fate? Do they understand the necessity of their sacrifice? Again, a barb that found its mark. How many had I personally executed over the centuries? Guardsmen who had fought alongside us against demonic incursions, civilians who had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time, all killed to maintain the secrecy of our order. their blood on my hands justified by necessity i pushed these thoughts aside the creature was attempting to distract me to create doubt a typical tactic of warp entities enough talk i said your existence ends here the obsidian figure smiled a cold expression devoid of warmth you cannot destroy me gray knight i am not merely this form you see before you i am the city i am the souls it contains I have endured for millions of your years waiting for the proper alignment, for the thinning of the veil that allows me to complete my work. What work? asked Thaddeus, his voice cautious. The preservation of consciousness, replied the figure. The creation of a repository of souls so vast, so perfect, that it transcends the limitations of your reality. When complete, it will exist simultaneously in all dimensions, all possible universes. A monument to consciousness itself, persisting even after the heat death of your universe. As it spoke, the rotating city began to spin faster, the light pulsing from the chamber walls intensifying. I could feel warp energy building around us, the very fabric of reality starting to thin. The alignment approaches, said the figure. The Nexus opens. Soon, my work here will be complete, and I shall move on to other worlds, other souls to preserve. I exchanged glances with Thaddeus. We both understood the implications. If this entity could extend its influence beyond Piety's end, billions of lives could be at risk. Entire sectors might fall to its preservation." "'Brother Galen,' I said, turning to him, "'your connection to this entity. Can you use it against it?' Galen hesitated, clearly struggling with internal conflict. "'I—I am not certain, Brother Captain, the visions it has shown me. There is a terrible beauty to its work, a perfect stillness that offers release from pain, from fear, from doubt. I gripped his shoulder, forcing him to look at me.' That is the entity talking, brother, not you. Remember your oaths. Remember who you are. For a moment, I feared we had lost him. Then, his expression hardened, resolve replacing uncertainty. I am a gray knight, he said. I am the Emperor's shield against the darkness, his sword against the never-born. He stepped forward, approaching the rotating city of Bone. The obsidian figure watched him with apparent curiosity. You come willingly? It asked. You wish to join my collection? I wish to understand, Galen replied, to see the city as it truly island. Before I could stop him, Galen removed his helmet, exposing his face to the chamber's atmosphere. A dangerous action on any world, but especially one tainted by warp influence. His eyes were closed, his expression serene as he extended his psychic senses toward the floating structure. Brother Galen! I called, moving to intercept him. But Thaddeus held me back. Wait. He said quietly. I believe I see his intent. Galen's eyes snapped open, now glowing with psychic energy. I see it now, he said, his voice resonating with power. I see the floor in your perfect city, ATH Toggle. The obsidian figure's serenity faltered for the first time. There is no floor, it insisted. Each soul is preserved exactly as it was at the moment of transformation. Yes, said Galen, that is the flaw. You capture them in a single moment, frozen in time. But consciousness is not static. It flows, changes, grows. By preserving these souls in amber, you deny them the very essence of what consciousness island. You offer not transcendence, but extinction. As he spoke, Galen's psychic energy flowed outward, connecting with the rotating city. Where his power touched, the bone-like material began to crack, hairline fractures spreading across its surface. No, cried the obsidian figure, its form flickering as it lunged toward Galen. I intercepted it, my force sword slashing through its midsection. This time, the blade cut cleanly, separating the figure at the waist. But instead of falling, the two halves remained suspended, the gap between them filling with the same swirling darkness we had seen in the cathedral above. You cannot destroy me, the entity repeated, its voice now a multi-layered chorus of countless souls speaking in unison. I am eternal. Nothing is eternal, I replied, not even the stars themselves. With a thought, I activated the teleport beacon once more, simultaneously sending the emergency signal to the strike cruiser in orbit. Three short pulses, the code for immediate implementation of Exterminatus Protocols. Brother Galen was still connected to the Bone City, his psychic energy causing more and more fractures to spread across its surface. The obsidian figure had reformed, but its movements were becoming erratic. Its form unstable as Galen's attack disrupted whatever process kept the souls bound to its creation. We need to withdraw, I told Thaddeus. The torpedoes will launch as soon as we are clear. Thaddeus nodded, moving to Galen's side. Brother, we must leave. Now. But Galen shook his head, never taking his eyes from the city. I cannot break the connection, he said. Not completely. And if I do not maintain it, the entity will simply repair the damage. Someone must remain to ensure it cannot recover before the torpedoes strike. I understood immediately what he was suggesting. Number. We leave together or not at all. Galen finally looked at me, a sad smile on his face. It is fitting, brother Captain. I have glimpsed what waits within that city. A part of me is already there. Let me make my final stand here, so that others might be spared what I have seen. Before I could argue further, the chamber shook violently. Dust and fragments of obsidian rained down from above. The connection to the cathedral must have been destabilizing, the warp energies growing wild as Galen's attack on the city disrupted the entity's control. Captain, Vox the leader of Squad Purifier urgently. The situation above is deteriorating rapidly. The darkness is expanding, consuming everything it touches. We cannot contain it much longer. Time was running out. I looked at Galen, saw the determination in his eyes, the acceptance of his fate. In that moment, I recognized something I had seen countless times before, in the eyes of battle brothers who knew they were making their final stand. the peace that comes with absolute certainty of purpose. Very well, brother, I said formally. Your sacrifice shall be remembered in the Librarious Aegis." Galen nodded once, then returned his attention to the Bone City, pouring more of his psychic energy into the attack. The fractures were spreading faster now, entire sections of the structure beginning to crumble, No! screamed the entity, its obsidian form shattering and reforming repeatedly as it struggled to maintain cohesion. Millennia of work. Perfect preservation. Thaddeus, I said. Initiate teleport. With a final salute to Brother Galen, we activated our teleport beacons. The familiar sensation of displacement washed over me as the strike cruiser locked onto our signals. The last thing I saw before the chamber disappeared was Galen, surrounded by a halo of psychic fire, his power tearing apart the abominable city of Bone and the countless trapped souls within it. We materialized on the teleportarium platform of the Strike Cruiser, immediately surrounded by servitors and tech priests, rushing to assist with the disengagement of our Terminator armor. Through the viewing port, I could see Piety's End below us. Its surface now marred by swirling storms of unnatural darkness centered on Martyrium. Status report, I demanded of the ship's captain, who stood at attention nearby, cyclonic torpedoes armed and ready for launch, my lord, he replied. Waiting your final authorization. I took one last look at the planet below. Somewhere down there, brother Galen was still fighting, still holding the entity at bay. A gray night to the last, standing against the darkness so that humanity might endure. His sacrifice would go unrecorded in any imperial history, his name unknown to those he died to protect. As it was for all of us. Launch the torpedoes, I ordered. May the Emperor's mercy be upon those souls already lost. The captain nodded to his weapons officer. Moments later, I felt the slight shudder as the cyclonic torpedoes detached from our vessel, streaking toward the doomed world below. They would take approximately 17 minutes to reach the surface. 17 minutes for Brother Galen to continue his final battle. Set course for Titan, I instructed the captain, maximum speed. Yes, my lord. As the ship's engines engaged, pushing us away from Piety's end, I found myself thinking of Galen's words about the entity's fundamental flaw. Consciousness is not static. It flows, changes, grows. By preserving souls in a single moment, the entity had denied them the very essence of what made them human. Was that not in some ways what had been done to us as grey knights? our pasts erased our futures narrowed to a single purpose we existed in a state of suspended growth our personalities constrained by necessity our humanity subordinated to duty these were dangerous thoughts bordering on heresy yet i could not dismiss them entirely as our ship entered the warp leaving behind the world that would soon be nothing but a lifeless husk I found myself questioning, for perhaps the first time in centuries, the nature of the sacrifice we grey knights were called to make. Not the sacrifice of our lives, that was expected of any servant of the emperor, but the sacrifice of our humanity itself, the price we paid for purity, It was a question without answer, a doubt to be buried alongside so many others, locked away in the vaults of my mind where even I rarely ventured, for duty came first. It always had, it always would, until the day I too made my final stand, unnamed and unremembered by those I died protecting. Such is the burden of silver, the weight we bear in silence, Three months after the destruction of Piety's End, I stood once more in the great hall of our fortress monastery on Titan. The Grand Master had summoned me personally to deliver my report on the Piety's End incident, an unusual procedure that spoke to the gravity of what had transpired. "'So you believe this entity, this ATH Tagle, was truly destroyed?' asked the Grand Master, his ancient face betraying no emotion. I cannot say with absolute certainty, Grandmaster, I replied honestly. Its nature was unlike any daemon we have previously encountered. It claimed to be older than humanity itself, to exist simultaneously in multiple dimensions. Yet Brother Galen was able to damage it, the Grandmaster observed, to disrupt its work. Yes, through the connection it had established with his mind during warp transit, a connection he turned against it." The Grand Master was silent for a moment, his eyes distant. Like all who reached his rank, he had faced horrors beyond imagining during his centuries of service, had made sacrifices that would break lesser men. I wondered if he too ever questioned the nature of our existence as gray knights. The cycle continues, he said finally. They rise, we stand against them, they fall, only to rise again in new forms, with new names, an endless war. Is victory possible in such a war? I asked, the question escaping before I could contain it. The Grand Master regarded me with sudden sharpness. Victory, brother Captain, number there is no victory to be had against the darkness, there is only vigilance, only duty, only sacrifice. He rose from his throne, approaching me with measured steps. You are troubled by Brother Galen's sacrifice. By the words of the entity regarding our nature as gray knights, it was not a question. The Grand Master's psychic abilities far exceeded my own. He would have sensed my disquiet, the questions that had plagued me since our return from Piety's end. I have served for 342 years, I said slowly." I have watched brothers fall in battle against the never-born. I have executed loyal imperial citizens to maintain our secrecy. I have done all that duty demanded without question or hesitation. But now you question, the Grandmaster said. Not accusingly, but with a strange understanding. The entity spoke of preservation at the cost of growth, I explained. It trapped souls in a single moment, denying them the chance to change, to evolve. I cannot help but see parallels to our own existence. We are taken as children, our pasts erased, our futures narrowed to a single purpose. We exist in a state of suspended growth, constrained by necessity. I expected censure for such thoughts, perhaps even accusations of heresy or corruption. what i did not expect was the grand master's nod of acknowledgement you are not the first to have such thoughts malric he said using my given name rather than my rank a rare intimacy nor will you be the last the burden of knowledge we bear is heavy the sacrifices we make are profound it would be strange indeed if such thoughts did not arise he turned gesturing for me to follow him to a viewing-port that looked out upon saturn's rings a spectacle of natural beauty that few outside our order would ever witness from this vantage point The question you must ask yourself is not whether our existence is just, or fair, or right. The Grand Master continued. Such concerns are luxuries we cannot afford. The question is whether it is necessary, whether the alternative would be worse. I considered this. The Grey Knights stood as humanity's final bulwark against demonic incursion. Without us, how many worlds would fall? How many billions of souls would be corrupted or destroyed? No. The price we paid, the sacrifice of our individual humanity, purchased the continued existence of humanity as a whole. I understand, Grand Master, I said at last. The burden is necessary, he turned to me, his ancient eyes holding mine. Necessary, yes, but never easy, never to be taken for granted. Each of us must come to terms with it in our own way. Some find solace in ritual, in prayer, others in the purity of combat against the never-born others still in the knowledge that though we may be forgotten the imperium endures because of our sacrifice and what of you grand master i dared to ask where do you find your solace a ghost of a smile touched his lips there and gone in an instant In moments like this, Malric, in seeing brothers like you and Galen uphold our purpose with such unwavering dedication, even in the face of questions that have no perfect answers. In knowing that while individuals may falter, the chapter endures. He placed a hand on my shoulder, an unexpectedly human gesture from one so exalted. Brother Galen's sacrifice has been recorded in the Librarious Aegis. His essence joins with those of all our fallen brothers, a collective wisdom and strength that will guide future generations of gray knights. He has not forgotten, Malric. None of them are. With that, he returned to his throne, his moment of personal connection clearly at an end. You will be assigned a new mission soon. The prognosticars have detected disturbing patterns in the halo stars. Preparations are already underway. I bowed, accepting the dismissal. I stand ready to serve Grandmaster. As I turned to leave, he spoke. Once more, brother Captain, the burden of silver is indeed heavy, but remember that you do not bear it alone. None of us do. I departed the Grandmaster's presence. My mind still troubled but my purpose renewed. He was right, of course. The questions had no perfect answers. The doubts would never fully disappear. but they did not need to. They could exist alongside duty, alongside purpose. Perhaps that was what truly separated us from the soulless automatons of the Adeptus Mechanicus, or from the unthinking beasts of the warp. The capacity to question, to doubt, even as we continued to fulfill our sacred duty. Three days later, I knelt in the fortress chapel, the hour of vulnerability observed as was our custom. My armor stood in its maintenance cradle nearby, its silver surface gleaming in the candlelight. I offered prayers for Brother Galen's soul, for Brother Octavius, and for all those who had fallen under my command over the centuries. And I offered a prayer for myself as well, not for preservation, or for glory, or even for strength in battle, but for the wisdom to bear the burden of silver with the dignity it deserved. To honor the sacrifice not just through victory against the Neverborn, but through remembrance of why we fought at all. For humanity, in all its flawed, chaotic, contradictory glory, for the right of consciousness to flow, to change, to grow. In the flickering candle-light, I thought I saw a face reflected in my armor's polished surface, a woman with amber eyes. She smiled at me, a gesture of such profound sadness and pride that it struck me to my core. Then the reflection was gone, if it had ever been there at all, a memory not quite erased. A psychic echo of someone I had once known, or simply the manifestation of my own doubt, my own need for connection to a past forever lost to me. It did not matter. I rose from my prayers, ready to dawn my armor once more, ready to bear the burden of silver for another day, for as long as duty required. For as long as humanity needed its silent, secret guardians, for I was a gray knight, not not a hero to be celebrated not a martyr to be mourned simply a weapon forged for a single purpose a blade that struck from shadows asking for no recognition expecting no glory and perhaps in the end that was enough

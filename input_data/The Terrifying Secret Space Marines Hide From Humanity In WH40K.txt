The terrifying secret space marines hide from humanity is one I was never meant to uncover. I remember when I first saw them, towering in their cobalt armor, the Emperor's angels incarnate. I was just a blind astropath, assigned to listen to their Vox communications aboard the Strike Cruiser. But in the hollow quiet of ship's night, I heard their prayers change. Not to the god-emperor, but to something ancient, hungry, something called Kositoire. The metallic taste of fear filled my mouth as their voices twisted, clicking between words like insects. When I accidentally accessed the gene vault, I understood why they hunted me. Their bodies were changing, their transformation never truly complete. What happens when humanity's greatest defenders are no longer human at all? I was nine years standard when the Space Marines of the Ultramarines chapter made planetfall on Hydrapha. Even at that tender age I had already been identified as possessing the witch site. The black ships had not yet come for me, but everyone knew they would. My parents kept me hidden away when the processions began, fearing I might be taken ahead of schedule. but I was a curious child. I slipped from our HAB unit while they slept, and joined the crowds that lined the silver processional way. The sound hit me first, a rhythmic thunder that seemed to vibrate through the ferrocrete beneath my feet. Then came the towering figures in cobalt blue power armor, each one a walking fortress of ceramite and transhuman flesh. I stared up at them, my witch-sight straining against the tight mental locks my father had taught me to maintain. Even with those barriers in place, I could sense something immense and ancient radiating from them. A presence that felt like staring into the heart of a storm. One of them turned his head as he passed. His helmet was off, carried in the crook of his arm. His face was pale as marble, his features so perfect they seemed carved rather than born. But his eyes. Emperor save me, his eyes were not human. They looked through me, past me, as if I were merely a thin curtain, and he was studying whatever lay behind. I fell to my knees without meaning to, not out of respect or awe. Though both crashed through me like tidal waves, I fell because my legs simply forgot how to hold me. In that moment, I understood what the preachers meant when they spoke of the divine. Not the warm, nurturing divinity of a mother's embrace, but the cold and terrible divinity of lightning that strikes where it will. I never forgot that face. How could I? It was the face of an angel. The emperor's angels, we call them. But angels are not men. And as I would learn many decades later aboard the strike cruiser Dominus Vindictus, sometimes angels fall. Sometimes, they were never angels at all. My name is Tyran Law. I am, or was, an imperial astropath, sanctioned and bound to the God-Emperor's service. This is my account of the nightmare I discovered while serving aboard the Dominus Vindictus, and why I now believe the Space Marines harbor secrets that would shatter the Imperium itself if ever brought to light. If you are hearing this, then my final transmission reached someone with both the courage to listen and the wisdom to act. The Inquisition will brand me heretic. the Adeptus Astartes will name me traitor. But before you judge, hear my testimony. Judge me then, if you still can. I was assigned to the Dominus Vindictus 143 days ago, by Terran standard. It was considered an honor. Few astropaths are chosen to serve directly alongside the Adeptus Astartes, and few are still among the vaunted Ultramarines. I had served with distinction in the Imperial Navy for twenty-seven years. My record was spotless, my loyalty beyond question. When the request came from Captain Aegem Mann himself, I accepted without hesitation. How could I refuse? They were the sons of Gilaman himself. the exemplars, the standard against which all other chapters were measured. The first thirty days passed without incident. I performed my duties as required, maintaining communications with other imperial vessels, and occasionally relaying messages to distant worlds when necessary. The Marines themselves rarely acknowledged me. This was not unexpected. To them, I was merely another tool, a specialized servitor of flesh rather than metal, but still, I served with pride. I was quartered in a small chamber adjacent to the ship's primary astropathic choir. Not that there was much of a choir to speak of, two other astropaths served aboard, but they were assigned to different shifts. We rarely crossed paths. My chamber was sparse by civilian standards but luxurious compared to the cramped conditions of most Imperial Navy vessels. I had a cot, a desk, a small shrine to the Emperor, and a private washroom. I wanted for nothing, save perhaps conversation. The isolation was not unusual for one of my station. Astropaths are rarely welcomed into casual social circles. Our vacant eye sockets, marked with the scars of our soul binding to the emperor, tend to unnerve normal humans. And the Astartes, well, they keep their own counsel. It was during the forty-seventh night cycle that I first noticed something amiss. I was meditating in my chamber, allowing my mind to drift through the currents of the warp, when I caught a whisper, a fragment of communication not meant for me. Space marines are resistant to psychic intrusion. Their minds are fortresses, rigorously trained and enhanced to repel any unwanted presence. But in that moment, as I floated in the liminal space between real space and the Empyrean, I brushed against something unexpected, a channel of communication, faint but distinct. At first, I thought it was a standard Vox transmission. But there was something about the cadence, the texture of it, that suggested otherwise. It carried the unmistakable resonance of psychic communication. Not the crude telepathy of an unsanctioned psycha, but something refined, ritualized. I hesitated. To deliberately eavesdrop on the private communications of the Adeptus Astartes was not merely a breach of protocol. It could be construed as treachery, But my curiosity, that same curiosity that had drawn me to the processional way as a child, pulled me forward. I listened. The words were high Gothic, formal and archaic. A prayer, I realized. Or what seemed like a prayer. But not to the emperor. The name they invoked was unfamiliar to me. A harsh, guttural sound that my mind struggled to translate. Cositoire, they called. Or something similar. My Gothic is excellent, but this word belonged to no dialect I had ever encountered. I withdrew immediately, my heart hammering in my chest. Sweats slicked my body despite the perpetual chill of the void ship. I told myself I had misheard, that the constant exposure to the warp had temporarily addled my senses. I reported to the medicare the next morning, claiming a minor headache. The apothecary, a stern-faced marine named Valius, examined me briefly before administering a mild sedative. He asked no questions, and I volunteered no information. For six days, I performed my duties without incident, pushing the strange experience from my mind. But on the seventh night, as I lay in my cot trying to sleep, I heard it again, stronger this time. Kosituary. Hear us. Guide our blades. Accept our offerings. The voice was deep, resonant with transhuman power. But there was something else in it. A hunger. A need. I sat upright, pressing my hands to my ears though I knew it would do no good. The words came not through my physical senses but directly into my mind. We bear your mark, we carry your seed, soon the flesh will yield, and the truth will emerge. I should have reported it. Any hint of heresy among the Adeptus Astartes should be immediately flagged for inquisitorial investigation. But who would believe me? A single astropath, claiming one of the most renowned chapters in imperial history was, Engaging in forbidden rituals, I would be executed for slander at best, branded a heretic myself at worst. I needed evidence. Proof that what I was hearing was real and not some warp-borne delusion. So I began to listen more intently during my off hours, casting my psychic senses outward like nets into the sea of minds that populated the great vessel. Most remained closed to me. The Marine's mental discipline was formidable, but as the ship entered its night cycle and most of the crew retired to their quarters, I found it easier to detect stray thoughts and emotions. fragments of dreams, whispers of fears, and occasionally, when multiple marines gathered in certain chambers deep within the vessel, those same ritual words, cositoire. The name haunted me, I began keeping a journal, recording every instance of the strange communications, dates, times, locations, when I could determine them. Names of Marines present, if their mental signatures were distinct enough for me to identify, it was dangerous work. If discovered, the journal alone would be enough to condemn me. But I felt compelled to continue, driven by a need to understand what was happening aboard the ship I had once been honored to serve upon. On the 73rd day of my assignment, I made a decision. I would attempt to visually confirm what I had been hearing, to witness with my own eyes what took place during these rituals, It was madness, of course. Even if I could locate one of their gatherings, how could I, a blind astropath, hope to observe without detection? But I had an advantage they did not suspect. Though my physical eyes had been burnt away during my soul binding to the emperor, leaving only scarred sockets behind, I was not truly blind. Few outside the astropathic choirs know this, but many of us develop a form of psychic sight. Not true vision as mortals understand it, but a perception of energy and form that allows us to navigate the world almost as effectively as those with functioning, and eyes. Some astropaths even claim to see more clearly than before their blinding, perceiving layers of reality hidden from normal sight. My own psychic vision had always been exceptionally acute. I could perceive not just the physical forms around me but trace elements of their psychic imprint as well." Emotions leave marks, thoughts cast shadows. Ritual and repetition carve channels that a trained mind can follow. I waited until the ship entered its night cycle, when the corridors were least populated. Then, I slipped from my quarters, moving with the practiced confidence of one who has long since adapted to his condition. I wore my standard robes, hoping that anyone I encountered would assume I was simply attending to some official business. Astropaths are known to keep strange hours, our duties often dictated by the unpredictable currents of the warp rather than any shipboard schedule. The rituals, I had determined, took place in the lower decks of the vessel, near the reinforced chambers that housed the ship's gene seed storage. This made a certain sense. The gene seed is sacred to the Astartes, the physical link between each marine and their primark. If there was some corruption, some heresy taking root among them, it would center around the gene seed. I made my way down through the labyrinthine passages of the strike cruiser, avoiding the main thoroughfares and transit lifts where possible. Twice I was forced to press myself into shadowed alcoves as patrol squads passed. My heart thundered in my chest, so loudly I feared they might hear it with their enhanced senses. but they moved on without pause their boot-steps fading into the omnipresent hum of the ship's systems as i descended the architecture changed subtly the utilitarian corridors of the upper decks gave way to older more ornate passageways arched ceilings stone-facing over adamantium walls statuary depicting astartes heroes of ages past their features worn smooth by time and reverent touches i was entering the sacred heart of the vessel where few mortals were permitted to tread the psychic resonance grew stronger with each level i descended not just the focused thoughts of individual marines but a collective presence a chorus of minds linked in common purpose the air felt thick charged with potential like the atmosphere before a storm and beneath it all a subtle wrongness that made my skin crawl a dissonance in what should have been the pure harmonious mental symphony of loyal astartes I followed that dissonance like a bloodhound tracking ascent, letting it draw me deeper into the bowels of the ship. The temperature dropped noticeably. My breath fogged before my face. The metal deck plates beneath my feet gave way to stone, ancient and worn. I recognized the signs from my studies at the Scolum Progenium. I was entering a section of the ship that predated the heresy, perhaps even dating back to the Great Crusade itself. The voices grew clearer as I approached what my psychic senses told me was a large chamber ahead, not spoken aloud, but transmitted mind to mind in that same ritualized pattern I had detected before. Cositoare, hidden truth, locked in gene and bone, we are your vessels. We prepare the way. I reached a massive door of dark metal, engraved with the Ultramarine's insignia and intricate designs that hurt my psychic sight to focus upon. It was sealed, as I had expected. But a sealed door is rarely an insurmountable obstacle to one with my gifts. I did not need to open it physically to perceive what lay beyond. I pressed my palm against the cold metal and extended my consciousness outward, slipping through the physical barrier as easily as normal men might pass through a curtain of smoke. What I witnessed within would forever shatter my faith in the Adeptus Astartes. The chamber beyond was vast, its ceiling lost in shadows despite the hundreds of candles that lined the walls. At its center stood a circular dais of black stone, surrounded by thirteen kneeling space marines. They had removed their helmets, but not their armor. In the flickering candlelight, their faces seemed oddly fluid, as if the features were not quite fixed in place. before them on the dais lay what i first took to be a sarcophagus a massive container of burnished metal its surface etched with sigils similar to those on the door but more complex more malevolent As I watched, the lid of the container slid open with a pneumatic hiss. From within rose a column of pale blue light, coalescing into a hololithic projection above the open casket. I expected to see the image of a Primark, perhaps Robeut Gilemon himself. What materialized instead defied comprehension. The figure was humanoid, but only in the most basic sense. Its proportions were wrong, its limbs too long and jointed in places where no joints should exist. The head was elongated, splitting at the jaw into mandibular structures that no human mouth could possess. But it was the eyes that transfixed me. Hundreds of them, covering the creature's form like luminous boils, each one blinking independently of the others. Cositoare. The Marines intoned as one, their voices reverberating both aloud and in the psychic plane. Father of the Hidden Path. Architect of the Final Evolution. The hololithic abomination raised its misshapen limbs in what might have been benediction. When it spoke, the sound bypassed my ears entirely, manifesting directly in my consciousness. My sons, it said, its voice like gravel sliding over glass. The time of revelation approaches. The seed I planted 10,000 years ago grows toward fruition. Soon, the transformation will be complete. One of the marines stood and approached the dais. Even from my psychic vantage, I recognized him. Captain Aegemman, the master of the watch, second only to Manios Calgar himself within the chapter hierarchy. He removed his right gauntlet and extended his bare hand into the column of light. The flesh of his arm began to ripple as if something moved beneath the skin. I watched in horror as his fingers elongated, the knuckles doubling, tripling in number until his hand more closely resembled the chitinous appendage of some Xenos arthropod than anything human. The transformation seemed to cause him no pain. Indeed, his face, now clearly visible to my psychic sight, bore an expression of rapturous ecstasy. The changes accelerate, great cositoire. Aegeman said, With each battle, with each implantation of new gene seed, we move closer to your design. But there are complications. The Inquisition grows suspicious of certain mutations they have detected among our newer recruits, and Gilliman stirs in his tomb on McCragg. If he should awaken. Gilliman is but one facet of myself, sundered long ago, the entity interrupted. A fragment, given independence to serve my greater purpose. His awakening is of no concern. Indeed, it may serve to accelerate our plans, continue as directed, increase the potency of the catalyst in the next batch of gene seed. Those who cannot withstand the transformation were never worthy vessels to begin with. I recoiled from the door, withdrawing my consciousness with such haste that I nearly lost cohesion. My physical body stumbled backward, a cry of denial rising in my throat before I could stifle it. The sound echoed in the empty corridor. For a terrible moment, I stood frozen, certain I had given myself away. but no alarm was raised. No armored giants burst through the doors to apprehend me. Either the thickness of the ancient metal had muffled my outburst, or the Marines were too absorbed in their blasphemous ritual to notice. I did not wait to find out which. I turned and fled, no longer caring about stealth or discovery. All that mattered was distance. I needed to get away, to process what I had seen, to determine what action I could possibly take against such heresy. As I ran, my mind reeled with implications. The Ultramarines, Paragons of Imperial Virtue, were compromised, not merely turning from the Emperor's light, but apparently engaged in a conspiracy dating back to the founding of their chapter. Perhaps even to the creation of the Primarchs themselves. And if one of the first founding chapters could harbor such secrets, what of the others? How deep did this corruption run? I reached my quarters without encounter, though whether by luck or design I cannot say. Once inside, I activated the privacy locks and sank to my knees before my small shrine to the Emperor. I prayed for guidance as I had never prayed before, for clarity, for courage, for some explanation that would render what I had witnessed as something other than the galaxy shattering heresy it appeared to be. No answer came, save the pounding of my own heart. Sleep eluded me that night. I paced my small chamber like a caged animal, the images of what I had seen playing on endless loop behind my empty eye sockets. I considered my options, few as they were. I could report my findings directly to the Inquisition. But how? The ship's astropathic choir was my only means of long-range communication, and it was constantly monitored by the ship's officers. any unauthorized transmission would be detected immediately. And even if I could send a message, what evidence did I have beyond my own testimony? The word of a single astropath against the honor of the Ultramarines chapter would carry little weight. I could attempt to gather more evidence, return to that forbidden chamber, perhaps find some way to record or document what took place there, but the risk was enormous. If caught, I would face interrogation and execution. And given what I now knew of the Marines' true nature, I doubted my death would be either quick or clean. I could do nothing. returned to my duties, pretend I had seen nothing, heard nothing, perhaps request a transfer at the next opportunity, citing health concerns or some other plausible excuse. But even as the thought formed, I dismissed it. Whatever was happening aboard the Dominus Vindictus, whatever heresy the ultramarines were engaged in, it represented a threat to the Imperium itself, to humanity. I could not in good conscience remain silent. As the ship's systems cycled into artificial day, I made my decision. I would continue my investigation, but with extreme caution, I would need allies, information, resources, none of which would be easy to come by aboard a vessel controlled by those I now suspected of the darkest heresy. For the next several days, I performed my duties with mechanical precision, betraying nothing of my inner turmoil. I intercepted and relayed communications as required. I participated in the daily rituals of maintenance and preparation that governed the lives of all who served aboard. But all the while, my mind worked, planning, calculating, searching for some way to confirm my suspicions and alert the proper authorities. On the seventy-ninth day of my assignment, an opportunity presented itself. The Dominus Vindictus received orders to rendezvous with an inquisitorial vessel, the Emperor's Judgment, near the Halo Stars, a joint operation against suspected genus-stealer activity on an imperial mining world. Under normal circumstances, I would have had no direct contact with the inquisitorial representatives. but their vessel included an astropathic choir master, Savin Mendel, with whom I had trained decades earlier at the Adeptus Astra Telepathica facility on Terra. If I could establish private communication with Savin, perhaps I could convey my concerns. An inquisitor would have the authority and resources to investigate the ultramarines properly, to determine if what I had witnessed was truly heresy or some misunderstanding born of my own ignorance, the rendezvous was scheduled for three days hence. I had that long to formulate a plan, to decide exactly what information I would share and how, too little, and I might be dismissed as, paranoid or delusional, too much, without sufficient evidence, and I risked being seen as the heretic myself. I spent those days in careful preparation, mentally composing and revising the message I would attempt to send to Savin. I also continued my covert observations of the Marines, particularly Captain Arjaman, and those I had identified as participants in the ritual. I noted subtle differences in their behavior that I had overlooked before, the way they sometimes tilted their heads at unnatural angles when they thought no one was watching. the clicking sounds that occasionally accompanied their speech, like mandibles chittering beneath the surface of their words. The way their gauntleted hands would sometimes spasm, fingers spaying and reconnecting in patterns that human joints should not allow. Small things, things that would be easy to dismiss individually, but taken together they formed a pattern too disturbing to ignore. On the night before the rendezvous, I made a critical error, In my determination to gather evidence, I attempted to access the ship's data archives, searching for any records related to gene seed storage, implantation procedures, or anomalies noted during apothecary examinations. I had some small skill with cogitator systems, enough to bypass the basic security protocols that governed most shipboard functions. But the gene seed records were protected by far more sophisticated measures. My clumsy attempts triggered silent alarms throughout the system. I realized my mistake too late. By the time I withdrew from the terminal and retreated to my quarters, security servitors were already mobilizing throughout the vessel. A ship-wide announcement ordered all non-essential personnel to remain in their assigned areas until further notice. A security breach had been detected. They did not name me specifically, but they did not need to. There were few aboard with both the access and the motive to target those particular files. It would not take, in them long to trace the attempt back to my terminal. My time was now measured in hours, perhaps minutes. I sealed myself in my quarters, though I harbored no illusions that a simple privacy lock would keep out Space Marines intent on my capture. I considered destroying my journal, but decided against it. If I was to be taken, the evidence of what I had uncovered might be my only bargaining chip, my only hope of being heard before judgment was passed. Instead, I prepared a message, not the careful measured communication I had planned to share with Savin, but a desperate, urgent warning. I encoded it using ciphers known only to senior astropaths, embedding it within what would appear to be standard background noise in the warp. If the emperor was merciful, it would reach someone with the authority and courage to act upon it. I had just completed the transmission when the door to my quarters exploded inward with a deafening crash. The psychic shockwave of rage that accompanied the intrusion nearly knocked me unconscious. I staggered back against the far wall as three massive forms filled the doorway, Space Marines in full battleplate, bolters raised and aimed at my chest. Their helmets concealed their features, but I did not need to see their faces to recognize the hatred radiating from them. At their center stood a fourth Marine, his armor distinguished by the white helmet and Narthesium arms that marked him as an apothecary. Valius. The same who had treated me weeks earlier. "'Astropath Tyran Law,' he said, his voice rendered flat and metallic by his helmet's voxcaster. "'You are charged with unauthorized access to restricted data archives. You will surrender yourself for interrogation. There was no point in denial, no point in resistance. I raised my hand slowly, palms outward in the universal gesture of submission. I will come peacefully,' I said, striving to keep my voice steady despite the terror constricting my throat.' But I request audience with Captain, Aegemman. What I have discovered concerns the safety of this vessel and potentially the Imperium itself. A harsh, buzzing laugh emanated from Valius's helmet. Not the laugh of a man, or even the harsh mirth of a transhuman warrior. It was the sound of insects swarming, of chitinous bodies rubbing against one another in obscene communion. Oh, you will have your audience, Astropath, he said. But I doubt it will proceed as you imagine. Two of the marines moved forward, seizing my arms with bruising force. I did not resist as they dragged me from my quarters and into the corridor beyond. There was no dignity in futile struggle, better to conserve my strength for the trials ahead. To remain alert for any opportunity, however slim, that might present itself. They did not take me to the ship's brig, as I had expected, nor to any interrogation chamber I was familiar with from my years of imperial service. Instead, they marched me deeper into the vessel, down through the same ancient corridors I had traversed on my illicit journey nights before. My heart sank as I realized our destination. They were taking me to the ritual chamber, to the thing they called cositoire. The journey passed in a blur of terror and desperate prayer. I recited every litany of protection I had ever learned, called upon every saint whose name I could remember. I doubt the Emperor heard me. If he did, he chose not to intervene. Perhaps he too had abandoned this vessel and its corrupted guardians. We reached the massive engraved doors I had encountered before. This time, they swung open at our approach, revealing the vast chamber beyond. It was as I had perceived it with my psychic sight, but somehow more terrible when experienced directly. The air was thick with incense and another odor, sweet and putrescent, like rotting fruit. The hundreds of candles still lined the walls, but now I could see that they were not made of wax. The material was translucent, yellowish, chitinous. The circular dais still dominated the center of the room. The sarcophagus-like container still rested upon it, but the container was open, and no hololithic projection rose from within. Instead, a figure stood before it, massive even by the standards of the Adeptus Astartes. Captain Aegeman turned as we entered, and I could not suppress a cry of horror. His face, once noble and stern in the tradition of all Ultramarines officers, had changed. His jaw had split along a vertical seam, revealing rows of needle-like teeth extending deep into a throat that pulsed with unnatural musculature. His eyes, once a piercing blue, had multiplied, smaller secondary and tertiary orbs clustering around the primary pair like satellites. They blinked independently of one another, focusing and unfocusing as they tracked our approach. Astropath, he said, his voice still recognizably human despite the inhuman configuration of his mouth. You have been busy, it seems. Accessing restricted files, sending unauthorized communications, spying upon sacred rites. Did you truly believe such actions would go unnoticed? I was thrust to my knees before him, the Marines gripping my shoulders with immovable force. I did not lower my gaze, though the sight of Aegemans' transformed visage sent waves of nausea through me. I believed I served the Emperor and his Imperium, I said, surprising myself with the steadiness of my voice. As you once did, before your corruption. A ripple passed through Aegemman's facial features, a wave of motion that momentarily rearranged his countenance into something resembling amusement. Corruption, he repeated, the words stretching and distorting as it passed his malformed lips. Such a limited perspective, what you call corruption, we recognize as ascension, evolution, The fulfillment of a design set in motion 10,000 years ago, when the emperor created the Primarchs not as generals for his armies, but as vessels for a power greater than himself. He gestured toward the open, sarcophagus. Cositoire was ancient when the emperor was young. A being of the warp, yes, but not a crude entity like the four that now dominate that realm. Cositoire is subtlety, patience, the slow and inexorable power of change working through generations. The Emperor did not defeat him, as your imperial history records. He made a pact with him, trading twenty sons as the seeds from which a new order would eventually grow. I shook my head, rejecting the blasphemy even as a terrible suspicion grew in my mind. The Primarchs, engineered by the Emperor, but scattered by unknown forces before his plans could come to fruition. the differences between the space marine chapters that extended beyond mere doctrine or tradition, the periodic instabilities in gene seed that required constant monitoring and culling, the horus heresy, I whispered, the division of loyalist and traitor legions. Agamman laughed again, that same chittering in human sound I had heard from Valius. A setback, nothing more. Cosituare's design unfolds across millennia, not mere centuries. Some vessels proved unstable, embracing change too rapidly and surrendering to mutation and madness. Others, like the sons of Gilaman, were designed for a slower transformation, more controlled, more insidious. He leaned closer, his distorted features filling my field of perception. The smell that emanated from him was not the clean antiseptic scent I associated with space marines. It was musky, organic. The odor of a creature molting, shedding one form to reveal another beneath. We are his true sons, Ajumman hissed. Not the degenerate followers of the ruinous powers who squandered their potential on petty godhood and self-indulgence, nor the stagnant lapdogs who blindly follow a corpse they call Emperor. We are the bridge between humanity's past and its ultimate future. i wanted to deny his words to reject them as the ravings of a heretic a traitor who had turned from the emperor's light but i had spent too many years in the imperial bureaucracy seen too many inconsistencies in the official histories to dismiss his claims entirely the imperium was built on secrets on lies deemed necessary to maintain order among the teeming billions who inhabited its worlds. What if this was merely one more terrible truth, hidden from all but the highest echelons of power? No. I could not allow such doubt to take root. Whatever Aegeanmen and his corrupted brothers believed, whatever pact they imagined had been made in the distant past, their actions represented a clear and present danger to humanity. To the Imperium I had sworn to serve. You are deluded, I said, corrupted by Xenos' influence or warp exposure. The Emperor created the Primarchs as his generals, his sons, not as vessels for some ancient abomination. Ajumman straightened, his multiple eyes blinking in complex patterns. Your opinion is irrelevant, astropath, as is your fate. But before you join the others who have discovered our truth over the centuries, you will serve one final purpose." He gestured to Valias, who stepped forward, the mechanical arms of his narthesium, extending with surgical precision. The apothecary has developed a method of extracting and preserving the memories of psychic individuals. Your knowledge, your experiences, even this conversation, will be catalogued and studied. We must understand how you penetrated our mental defenses, how you perceived our rituals despite the wards in place. Such weaknesses cannot be allowed to persist as we approach the final phase of our transformation. Valius moved behind me, his armored gauntlets gripping my head with bruising force, turning it to expose the neural implants at the base of my skull. All astropaths receive such implants during their training, interfaces that help us control and direct our abilities. Now, it seemed, those same implants would be used to violate my mind in ways their creators never intended. I felt the cold touch of metal, against my flesh as the narthesium connected to my neural ports. A sharp pain lanced through my skull, followed by a creeping numbness that spread downward through my body, paralyzing my limbs even as it left my consciousness intact. Begin the extraction. Agamemond ordered. The pain was beyond description, beyond endurance. It was as if every memory, every thought, every fragment of identity was being pulled physically from my brain, one nerve ending at a time. I screamed until my voice gave out, then continued screaming inside my mind, unable to express the agony in any physical way as my body remained locked in artificial paralysis. Through it all, I remained horribly conscious. aware of Valius standing behind me, of the machines humming as they recorded and stored the contents of my mind. Of Ajumman watching with his multiplicity of eyes, his split jaw working in that same chitinous clicking that now featured prominently in my nightmares, I do not know how long the procedure lasted. Time loses all meaning when every moment is an eternity of suffering. But eventually, the pain receded, replaced by a hollow emptiness, A sense of loss so profound it transcended physical sensation. Parts of me were gone, excised, stored in whatever barbaric devices the corrupted apothecary had attached to my neural implants. The extraction is complete, Captain," Valius reported, his voice seeming to reach me from across a vast distance. Primary memory centers have been copied and wiped. Personality matrix has been preserved for further study. Motor functions remain intact but uncontrolled. Aegemian leaned over me, his distorted features swimming in and out of focus as my vision wavered. Can you hear me, Astropath? Can you understand what has happened to you? You still exist, after a fashion. But the person you were, the identity you clung to, has been removed. Your body remains useful, however. A vessel, much like we are vessels, though of a far inferior design. I tried to, respond, to curse him with what little defiance remained in me. But my lips would not move, my tongue lay inert in my mouth. I could still breathe, still blink, still perceive the world around me. But I could not interact with it. I had become a passenger in my own flesh. Take him to the conversion chamber, Ajahnman ordered. His psychic abilities make him valuable stock for the next phase of breeding. We waste nothing. Breeding. The word echoed through the hollow cavern that had once contained my identity. Breeding what? For what purpose? But no answers came as the Marines lifted my unresponsive body and carried me from the ritual chamber. The corridors passed in a disjointed blur. My perception fragmented, shards of awareness coming and going like vox signals breaking up in a warp storm. I glimpsed other chambers branching off from the main passageways, laboratories filled with bubbling vats of fluid in which half-formed shapes pulsed and writhed, holding cells containing figures that might once have been human, their bodies twisted into configurations that denied classification as either man or zenos. And everywhere, the symbol I had seen engraved upon the ritual chamber doors, that intricate sigil that hurt my psychic sight to focus upon. Now I understood why. It was not merely a decorative pattern or even some heretical rune. It was a visual representation of genetic code. The blueprint for the transformation these corrupted Astartes were undergoing. They brought me to a smaller chamber deep within the ship's bowels. Unlike the ornate ritual space, this room was clinically sterile. metal tables lined with restraints, surgical equipment arranged with meticulous precision, tanks of bubbling nutrients connected to feeding tubes and monitoring devices, They stripped me of my robes and secured me to one of the tables, though the restraints were hardly necessary given my paralyzed state. Valius approached again, his narthesium whirring as it configured itself for some new procedure. Your psychic potential will serve the breeding program well, he said, his voice still carrying that unsettling harmonic buzz. The offspring resulting from your genetic material may prove useful as specialized communication vessels for the next generation. Offspring, breeding. The words conjured images too horrific to contemplate. What manner of abominations were these fallen Astartes creating in the depths of their strike cruiser? And to what end? Valius must have read the question in my eyes, the only part of me still capable of expression. He leaned closer, his helmet now removed to reveal a face even more distorted than Aegemans. Where the captain's transformation seemed still in progress, the apothecaries was much further advanced. His head had elongated into an ovoid shape, the cranium bulging to accommodate a brain clearly larger than any humans should be. His lower jaw had fully separated into mandibular appendages that clicked and scraped against one another as he spoke. you wonder about our purpose he said why we pursue this path of transformation what ultimate goal drives us to embrace what you perceive as corruption one of his narthesium arms extended a needle-like appendage hovering near my immobile face i could tell you I could explain the grand design that was set in motion before the birth of the Imperium itself. I could describe the glory that awaits those with the courage to evolve beyond the limitations the Emperor sought to impose upon mankind. But such concepts require context you no longer possess, with so much of your identity excised, the needle descended, puncturing the flesh of my neck, A cold sensation spread from the injection site, a wave of chemical detachment that further distanced me from my body and its fate. Instead, you will experience the truth directly. Your flesh will be repurposed, your genetic material harvested and combined with specific markers from our own modified gene seed. Resulting hybrids may lack the full potential of true Astartes, but they will serve admirably in specialized roles. Communication, navigation, perhaps even infiltration of other imperial organizations. As the drugs took hold, my consciousness began to drift, untethered from the physical form that had housed it for decades. I floated above the surgical table, a disembodied observer as Valius and his assistants began their grisly work, Incisions were made, samples taken. My body, still technically alive but now little more than organic raw material, was systematically violated in the name of their twisted evolution. And yet, some spark of self remained. Some core of identity that even their memory extraction technology had failed to excise. Perhaps it was my connection to the Emperor, forged during the soul-binding ritual that had claimed my physical eyes but granted me far greater sight. Perhaps it was simply the stubborn resilience of the human spirit, refusing to be extinguished even when all else was lost. Whatever the cause, I clung to that spark as my awareness continued to drift. Away from the conversion chamber, away from my desecrated flesh, through the bulkheads and decks of the Dominus Vindictus, pulled by a current I could neither see nor resist. I found myself in the astropathic choir chamber, the place where I had performed my duties for months before discovering the terrible truth about my masters. It was empty now, the other astropaths presumably confined to quarters during the security alert my actions had triggered. but the choir chamber was never truly empty. The specialized equipment within, designed to amplify and focus psychic energies for transmission through the warp, hummed with latent power. And there, at the center of the chamber, glowed the spectral outline of the ship's astropathic matrix, the artificial construct that coordinated and enhanced our abilities. I had worked with the matrix daily during my service aboard, had learned its patterns, its frequencies, its unique resonance. Now, divorced from physical form, I recognized it as more than mere technology. It was a nexus, a junction point between real space and the Imperian. A gateway. With nothing left to lose, I cast myself toward that glowing nexus. My consciousness, fragmented and incomplete but driven by desperate purpose, merged with the Matrix. The sensation defied description. It was not pain, though it shared pain's intensity. It was not pleasure, though it carried pleasure's release. It was transformation, transcendence. I ceased to be tyrant law, astropath of the Imperium, and became something else, something both more and less than human. I became the message. The matrix, designed to transmit the focused thoughts of trained astropaths across the void, now transmitted the totality of what remained of my being. My experiences, my discoveries, my warnings, all compressed into a single coherent signal and hurled into the warp with the full power of the Dominus Vindictus's astropathic array behind it. I felt myself stretch and distort as the warp currents caught me, tearing what remained of my consciousness into scattered fragments. But each fragment carried the same urgent warning, each splinter of my former self raced outward in all directions, seeking receptive minds, seeking aid. Most would be lost. Dissolved in the chaotic tides of the Empyrean, or devoured by the predators that lurk in those immaterial depths, some might reach their destinations so corrupted as to be unintelligible. But perhaps, if the Emperor still watched over his domain, one fragment might survive intact, one warning might reach ears with the power to act upon it. As my consciousness dispersed, I caught fleeting glimpses of the Materium from perspectives impossible for corporeal beings. I saw the Dominus Vindictus as if from outside, a moat of metal drifting in the infinite void. I saw other ships, other worlds flashing past with impossible speed as fragments think of myself hurtled toward them through the warp and i saw something else something vast and patient stretching across time and space in a web of subtle influence cositoire not as a mere entity or even a warp god but as a principle a process the embodiment of evolution itself, working through countless vessels across ten thousand years towards some incomprehensible culmination. I saw gene seed, that miraculous substance that transforms ordinary men into space marines, for what it truly was. Not a gift from the Emperor to elevate humanity, but a vector, a delivery mechanism for changes too subtle to detect until they had progressed beyond the point of containment. Changes that were even now approaching some critical threshold among certain chapters of the Adeptus Astartes, The Ultramarines were not unique in their corruption, they were simply further along the path than most, their transformation accelerated by some unknown catalyst. But all Astartes carried the seed of Cositoire within them, planted at the moment of their creation, nurtured by every battle, every wound, every implantation of new gene-seed material. This was the terrible truth I had discovered, the secret the Space Marines hid from humanity. They were not, and never had been, the perfect warriors the Emperor intended. They were incubators for something new, something that would eventually transcend both humanity and the Astartes themselves. Whether this evolution would prove humanity's salvation or its extinction, I could not say. The designs of entities like Kositoire transcend such binary concepts. But I knew with absolute certainty that the Imperium, founded on the worship of the Emperor and the purity of mankind, could not survive the revelation. My warning, sent as it was from a dying consciousness fragmented by trauma and warp exposure, would likely be dismissed as the ravings of a damaged mind. The evidence I had gathered stored in a journal now presumably destroyed by the marines, would never reach those with the authority to act upon it. And even if it did, would they have the courage to move against the Adeptus Astartes, the Emperor's finest warriors, based on the testimony of a single astropath? These thoughts, my final coherent musings as tyrant law, dispersed along with the remainder of my consciousness. The fragments of my being, carrying their terrible warning, vanished into the immeasurable depths of the warp. My existence ended not with a dignified death in the Emperor's service, but with dissolution, oblivion. And yet, and yet, I still speak, I still warn. Some fragment of me, against all odds, has survived the journey through the war, has found a receptive mind capable of receiving my message and transmitting it further. Perhaps you, perhaps someone else who will hear or read these words and understand their import. The space marines are changing, have been changing since their creation. and the change accelerates with each passing year, each new generation of gene seed implantation. The signs are there for those with eyes to see, Mutations dismissed as aberrations, physical quirks attributed to specific chapter heritage, behavioral patterns rationalized as combat doctrine or tradition, watch them, study them, note how they move when they believe no eyes are upon them. Listen to their private Vox transmissions, filtered through multiple encryption layers, observe the subtle differences between the ancient revered dreadnoughts and the newest primaris creations supposedly purer than their predecessors but in truth merely redirected along a different evolutionary path They are not as they appear, not as imperial myth portrays them. The angels have fallen, though they do not know it themselves. And in their fall, they may drag humanity with them into an abyss of transformation from which there can be no return. I am Tyran Law. I was an astropath. I served the Emperor faithfully. I discovered a truth too terrible to contain. And, now I am gone, my physical form repurposed by those I once revered, my consciousness scattered across the void, all that remains is this message, this warning, heed it, act upon it. Before the transformation is complete, before the final phase of Kosituare's grand design comes to fruition, Before the Space Marines cease to be humanity's protectors and become the architects of its extinction, Emperor protect us all. For I fear even he may not have foreseen the true nature of the weapons he created to safeguard mankind. The Astartes were meant to be humanity's shield, but shields can be turned against those they were forged to protect, and weapons can find their own purpose, independent of their creator's intent. The transmission ends here. I have expended the last of my coherence, the final fragments of identity that survived my dissolution in the warp. Whether my warning reaches those with the will to act upon it, I cannot know. Whether humanity can survive the revelation of its defenders' true nature, I cannot predict. I go now into whatever awaits those whose existence ends not in death but in dispersal. Perhaps the Emperor will gather the scattered fragments of my consciousness and grant me the peace I could not find in life. Perhaps oblivion will claim me utterly, my brief candle of awareness extinguished forever in the infinite darkness between stars. Whatever fate awaits, I face it knowing I have done all that remains possible. I have witnessed. I have testified. I have warned. The rest lies in your hands, whoever you may be, whatever you may become. I am Tyran Law. I was an astropath. I saw the truth. And now, so have you.

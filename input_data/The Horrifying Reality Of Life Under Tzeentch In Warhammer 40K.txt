I still remember my name, Marlon Vork, Archivist Third Grade, Section 12, Western Wing of the Grand Library of Change. I repeat these facts each morning before opening my eyes, clutching them like talismans against the shifting reality outside my skull. This ritual is the only constant in a world where constants no longer exist. Carathis was once renowned across the sector for its scholars and grand universities. the spires of hivementoris reached toward the stars, home to generations of imperial thinkers who catalogued the universe with meticulous precision. The administratum valued our world for our record-keeping and analytical minds. We took pride in our certainty, our clerical perfection, How foolish we were. I awakened to the now familiar sensation of my bones settling into new configurations beneath my skin. The pain has lessened over time, or perhaps my capacity for registering it has simply eroded. My quarters remain sparse, a small mercy granted by my station. The fewer possessions one owns on Carathis, the fewer opportunities to notice when they transform overnight. My single shelf of personal books shifts daily, their spines displaying titles I never purchased but somehow remember reading. I dress slowly in my archivist robes. The fabric feels different against my skin each morning, sometimes rough like sandpaper, sometimes slick like oil. Today they feel almost normal, though the color seems more vibrant than yesterday, a deeper shade of blue that shimmers with hidden patterns when I move. The Imperial Aquila, embroidered on the breast pocket, has grown an extra head since last week. No one has mentioned it. The corridors of the archivist habitation block twist in new configurations. I have learned to trust not my memory of the path, but rather the subtle pull behind my sternum that guides me to my workplace. some of my colleagues have not adapted so quickly they disappear after taking wrong turns into passages that seal behind them we do not speak of the screams morning benediction calls archivist lavesha as i pass her face has remained relatively stable these past few cycles though her eyes have multiplied today i count seven arranged in a crescent pattern across her forehead three weeks ago she had only the standard too knowledge is transformation i respond with the customary phrase the words taste of copper on my tongue the newest shipment arrived during night cycle she says falling into step beside me primary catalogues are already beginning to incorporate the material I nod, not trusting myself to speak further. Shipments from the surface mean new books, new information patterns to absorb into the library's collection, new vectors for change. The Grand Library of Change stands at the center of what was once Hive Mentoris, The original structure was a marvel of imperial Gothic architecture, all flying buttresses and stained glass depicting saints of knowledge and imperial heroes with quills and scrolls. Now the building breathes. The stone pulses with veins of iridescent material that scholars have learned not to look at directly. The stained glass windows still depict saints, but their faces contort in expressions no human should be capable of, and their halos have transformed into writhing tentacles of light. We pass through security, where servitors scan our minds for insufficient adaptability. Their augmentic components have fused with fleshier elements that pulse and twitch. One fixes me with a gaze from an eye embedded in its voice grill. Archivist Vork. It buzzes. You retain excessive stability markers. I serve the library, I respond, keeping my thoughts carefully blank. The servitor's eye narrows, then widens to an impossible diameter before snapping shut. Proceed. It says eventually. Catalog section 12 requires your attention. Anomalies have been detected. Anomalies. The word should be meaningless in a place where reality itself is in constant flux, yet the library maintains its own internal logic. Anomalies mean dangerous divergence from the planned metamorphosis. They mean my intervention is required. I part ways with Leviscia at the central atrium. Once a soaring dome of marble and gold, it now resembles the interior of some vast organism. The ceiling pulses with peristaltic motion, and the floor squelches beneath our feet. Columns that once supported the physical structure now serve as conduits for knowledge, information flowing visibly through translucent veins embedded in the stone. Occasionally, these veins bulge as packets of data surge through them, accompanied by whispers that echo in the mind rather than the ear. Archivists move purposefully through the space, each locked in their private communion with the library's ever-changing contents. Some bear visible marks of favor, their forms altered to better serve their functions. Magister Helik floats ten centimeters above the floor, his legs having been replaced by a slowly undulating mass of tentacles that never quite touch the ground. Scribe Tula's fingers have elongated to twice their natural length, allowing her to catalogue multiple texts simultaneously. Her eyes have been replaced by crystalline structures that refract the light in nauseating patterns. I keep my gaze fixed forward, focusing on the entrance to the western wing. Section 12 awaits, with its rows upon rows of constantly shifting texts. The archival stacks loom ahead, and I steal myself for another day of watching knowledge transform itself before my eyes. The first indication that today will be different comes when I reach my station. The familiar desk where I have worked for what might be years appears undisturbed, but the catalog crystal glows with an unusual color, a shade of purple so deep it borders on black. I place my hand upon it cautiously, and information floods my consciousness. Section 12. Subsection Gamma. Shelf 9. Anomalous transformation detected. Historical records, deviating from approved metamorphosis patterns. I frown. Historical records are typically the most stable texts in the library, shifting only in interpretation rather than fundamental fact. For them to deviate suggests a deeper corruption, perhaps even resistance to change. Such resistance is dangerous, not just to the texts themselves but to those of us who work with them. I make my way through the stacks, navigating the labyrinthine shelves that occasionally rearrange themselves when not directly observed. The smell of old parchment mingles with newer, less definable scents, like ozone, and something sweetly floral that makes my sinuses burn. The lighting dims as I penetrate deeper into the section, provided now only by luminous fungi that grow between the shelves, casting everything in a sickly blue glow. Subsection gamma appears relatively stable today, though the shelf numbers occasionally flicker and change as I pass. I count carefully, mouthing the numbers to anchor them in reality. 7 8 9 i stop before the ninth shelf and scan the spines of the books there most appear normal bound in human or xeno's skin depending on their subject matter but one volume catches my attention immediately a plain black book with no visible title Its presence feels wrong somehow, as though it occupies its space on the shelf without fully committing to existence in our reality. Protocol dictates that I should report this immediately to a magister, but something stops me. A curiosity that I thought had been purged from my mind long ago stirs weakly. Before I can reconsider, I reach out and touch the book's spine. The sensation is electric. My fingertips tingle with recognition, though I cannot consciously recall ever seeing this volume before. With trembling hands, I slide it from the shelf, half expecting alarms to sound or the book itself to transform in my grasp. Neither occurs. The cover is featureless, save for a single silver rune that shifts and changes as I. Try to focus on it. I open the book, and the pages inside appear blank at first glance. But as I stare, text begins to form, words coalescing from the paper itself as though rising from deep beneath the surface. The unaltered history of Carathis. I read aloud, and the words echo strangely in the quiet stacks. A history that has not been changed. The concept is so foreign that I struggle to comprehend it. Everything changes on Karathis. Everything transforms. The idea of permanence is not merely forgotten but actively hostile to our new existence. I should close the book. I should return it to the shelf and report its existence. I should walk away. Instead, I begin to read. The text describes Akharathis I almost remember, a world of scholars and thinkers dedicated to the imperial truth. It speaks of the first subtle signs of corruption that were overlooked, the gradual infiltration of Xientian cult elements into the scholarly classes. It details the catastrophic ritual that tore open the veil between real space and the warp, allowing the essence of the changer of ways to seep into our reality. But most disturbingly, it speaks of resistance, of those who fought against the transformation, who clung to static truth even as reality itself rebelled against the concept. It names names, some familiar, some forgotten, and there, listed among a cell of truth preservers, is a name I know all too well. Malinvork. My hands shake so violently that the book nearly slips from my grasp. This cannot be correct. I have served the library loyally since. Since. The memory slips away from me like water through cupped hands. How long have I been an archivist? When did I first don these robes? When did the change begin? I cannot recall, and this sudden gap in my knowledge terrifies me more than any physical transformation I have witnessed. Archivist Vork, a voice speaks from behind me. You have discovered something interesting. I slam the book shut and spin around, coming, face to face with Magister Helik. His floating form casts strange shadows in the fungal light, and his expression is unreadable on a face that no longer contains entirely human features. Magister? I stammer. I was just investigating the anomaly. This text appears resistant to change. I was about to report it. Helik's lips curl in what might be a smile. Were you? How fascinating. And did you discover why this particular text resists our master's blessing? The way he watches me makes it clear he already knows the answer. I swallow hard, my throat suddenly dry. It appears to be a historical record, I say carefully. Perhaps its factual nature provides some intrinsic stability. Facts, Helik says, the word dripping with disdain. Such a limiting concept. Truth is malleable, archivist Vork. Reality bends to perception. Surely you have learned this by now. He extends a hand, and I notice with a start that his fingers now number eight, each tipped with a delicate claw. The book, please. I should hand it over. Every instinct for self-preservation screams at me to comply, to apologize for my curiosity, to beg forgiveness for my transgression, But something deeper, something I had thought long buried, stops me. I need to complete my examination. I hear myself say, for the catalogue record. Helix expression shifts, the arrangement of his features sliding into a new configuration that radiates danger. You forget yourself, Archivist. The book, now. My grip on the volume tightens. With respect, Magister, Protocol 9-7-3 states that all anomalous texts must be fully documented before removal from the stacks. I have no idea if such a protocol exists, or if protocols even hold meaning in our ever-changing bureaucracy. But the invocation of rules seems to give Hellick pause. Very well, he says after a moment. Complete your documentation. You have until the end of this cycle. I will expect your report, and the book, on my desk before you retire. He, turns and drifts away, his lower tentacles writhing with what I interpret as agitation. I wait until he disappears from view before allowing myself to breathe again. The book feels heavier in my hands now, weighted with dangerous potential. I need to find somewhere private to examine it properly, somewhere away from prying eyes and the omnipresent surveillance of the library. My cataloguing cubicle is too exposed, the reading rooms are monitored, the archivist's common areas are always occupied. But there is one place, a maintenance closet tucked away in a corner of section 12 that seems to exist in a blind spot of the library's awareness. I discovered it months ago when seeking refuge from a particularly intense wave of changes that left several of my colleagues transformed beyond recognition. I make my way there now, taking a circuitous route and pausing frequently at shelves to pantomime routine work. The closet is small, barely large enough for a single person, but it contains a defunct data terminal that provides a faint, constant light. I slip inside and pull the door closed behind me. Here, in this forgotten space, I open the book once more. The text seems clearer now, more stable. I begin to read systematically, searching for answers about myself, about Karathis, about how we came to accept the unacceptable. Hours pass as I absorb the true history of my world. Karathis was indeed a center of imperial learning, but it was also home to a secret heresy. Scholars seeking forbidden knowledge turned to darker sources of information, gradually forming a cult dedicated to Tsiench. the corruption spread slowly at first then with increasing speed as key positions of power fell to the cultists the ritual that opened karathis to the warp took place five years ago performed by the combined psychic might of three hundred compromised psychas The imperial response was swift but insufficient. The Ordo Malleus quarantined the planet but lacked the resources for a full purge. And so Carathis was left to its fate, its population slowly warping under the influence of the changer of ways. But there was resistance. A network of loyalists who fought to preserve unchanged knowledge, to maintain their humanity against the tide of mutation and madness. And I, Malinvork, had been one of them. The final pages detail a desperate plan to smuggle uncorrupted texts off-world, to preserve some fragment of the truth beyond the reach of Xiench's influence. The plan failed. The loyalists were captured, their leaders publicly executed, the rest were given to the magisters for re-education. I close the book, my mind reeling. If this account is true, then I am not what I believe myself to be. My memories, my loyalty to the library, my acceptance of the change, all of it is artificial, imposed upon me after my capture. The real Malin Vork fought against this corruption. But if my memories are false, then who am I now? What remains of the man who resisted? I have no time to contemplate these questions. The door to the closet swings open suddenly, and I find myself staring up at Archivist Leveshire." all seven of her eyes focus on me with predatory intensity the magister is looking for you she says her voice harmonizing with itself in dissonant tones and for the book you were supposed to deliver i clutch the volume to my chest mind racing I lost track of time. The documentation was more complex than anticipated. Lavisha's eyes narrow in perfect unison. He is most displeased. Come with me now, and perhaps your punishment will be merciful. I rise slowly, considering my options. They are pitifully few. The library is a labyrinth, and even if I could navigate its constantly changing pathways, where would I go? The entire planet is corrupted. There is no sanctuary to be found. Yet surrender means not just my death, but the destruction of the truth I now hold. The last uncorrupted account of what happened to Karathis, and perhaps more, importantly, what happened to me. Of course, I say, stepping forward, as though to follow her. Then, as I draw alongside her, I shove her with all my strength. She stumbles, surprised by the sudden aggression from a normally compliant archivist. I dart past her into the stacks, clutching the book to my chest, like the precious artifact it is. Her shrieks of rage follow me as I flee, a multi-toned wailing that seems to come from everywhere at once. The sound will attract attention. I have minutes at most before the entire library is hunting me. I navigate the stacks by instinct, taking random turns, doubling back, climbing ladder stairs to higher levels, only to descend again elsewhere. The layout shifts around me, sometimes helpfully providing exits where none existed before, sometimes closing off promising escape routes with newly formed walls of books. The library itself seems uncertain whether to help or hinder me. Eventually I find myself in an unfamiliar section, The lighting here is different, a warm amber rather than the blue fungal glow of my usual haunts. The books on these shelves are bound in materials I cannot identify, and their titles are written in scripts that hurt my eyes to look upon. I pause, gasping for breath, and listen. The sounds of pursuit seem distant now, echoing from far-off corridors. Perhaps I have gained a temporary reprieve. A movement catches my eye. Between the shelves, something shifts. Not an archivist or a magister, but something else entirely. A figure that seems composed of angles that should not exist. Its form suggesting a human silhouette while simultaneously denying such simple categorization. Archivist Vork. It says, though I detect no mouth in its shimmering outline, you have strayed far from your assigned section. I press myself against the shelves, the spines of unknown books digging into my back. What are you? The figure tilts what might be its head. I am the librarian, the first and the last, the keeper of all, and knowledge, both that which is and that which will be. A chill runs through me. The librarian is a myth, a story told to new archivists to ensure their compliance. The entity that oversees the transformation of knowledge, the direct servant of Tsiench within the grand library of change. You do not exist, I whisper. Existence is a fluid concept on Karathis. The librarian responds, its form rippling with what might be amusement. as you are beginning to understand. It gestures toward the book, I still clutch protectively. You have found something interesting, something that should not be. It's the truth, I say, surprised by the firmness in my voice. Truth, the librarian echoes. Another fluid concept. What you hold is merely one version of events, frozen in time, resistant to improvement, an aberration. It's what really happened, I insist, before the change. Before Xieinch corrupted everything. The librarian's form shimmers, expanding and contracting in what I somehow know is laughter. Corruption implies deterioration, archivist. What has happened to Karathis is evolution, adaptation, improvement. It glides closer, and I press myself harder against the shelves, wishing I could sink into them. Your world was stagnant. Your scholars recorded the same facts generation after generation, trapped in a prison of fixed knowledge. Now, information is alive. It grows, changes, becomes more than it was. Is that not the true purpose of learning? Learning requires truth as its foundation, I argue. Without truth, knowledge is meaningless. You still cling to old limitations, the librarian says, a note of disappointment in its inhuman voice. Even after all this time, after all the work we have done to free your mind, it reaches toward me with a limb that seems to elongate impossibly. Give me the book, Malinvork. It is an anchor weighing you down, preventing your ascension. Surrender it, and I will show you wonders beyond your comprehension. I clutch. The book tighter, turning my body to shield it. No. The librarian pauses, its form flickering with what might be surprise. No? After all this time, you still possess the capacity for defiance. Fascinating. Perhaps we were too gentle in your re-education. You failed, I say, a realization dawning even as I speak the words. Your conditioning didn't fully take. That's why I was assigned to catalog duty, wasn't it? You were still watching me, waiting to see if I would break free. You were an experiment, the librarian acknowledges, a particularly stubborn subject. Most minds surrender to the change willingly after sufficient preparation. Yours has shown remarkable resistance. The Magisters thought it an interesting case study in the limits of human obstinacy. Its form shifts again, growing larger, more threatening. But all experiments must eventually conclude. Your time as an independent variable has ended, Archivist Vork. Now you will be fully incorporated into the grand equation. It lunges toward me with sudden speed, its form stretching and distorting. I dive to the side, rolling beneath a reading table and scrambling to my feet on the other side. The librarian flows after me, no longer bothering to maintain even a semblance of human form. I run again, deeper into the unknown section, the book still clutched to my chest. The shelves around me begin to move, sliding together to block my path. I veer left, then right, seeking any opening in the closing maze. Up ahead I spot a door set into the wall, unmarked and unadorned. With no other options, I lunge for it, grasping the handle and wrenching it open. I throw myself through without looking, slamming it shut behind me. I find myself in darkness so complete it seems solid. The air is cold and still, with none of the organic smells that permeate the rest of the library. I fumble in my robes for the small luminator I carry for examining texts in poorly lit areas, Its soft glow reveals a narrow staircase, leading downward, cut from stone so plain and unchanging that it seems almost offensive after years surrounded by transmuting architecture. With no other choice, I begin to descend. The staircase spirals downward for what feels like hours, though my timepiece, its face now sporting 15 hours instead of the traditional 12, suggests only 20 minutes have passed. Eventually, I reach the bottom, where another unmarked door awaits. I hesitate before this new threshold. The book in my hands pulses gently, as though encouraging me forward. I take a deep breath and open the door. Beyond lies a chamber that defies my expectations. After the organic horror of the library above, I find myself in a space of stark imperial architecture, all right angles, and unadorned stone. The lighting comes from simple glow globes that emit a steady, unwavering illumination, and in the center of the room stands a circle of cogitator units, their screens displaying green text on black backgrounds, utterly devoid of the shifting patterns that infect all other technology on Carathis. Most shocking of all are the people. men and women in simple robes unmarked by mutation their faces possessing the proper number of features arranged in standard human configuration they look up as i enter expressions of surprise and alarm crossing their ordinary faces one of them an older man with a close-cropped grey beard steps forward How did you find this place?" He demands. His voice harsh with suspicion. His hand moves to a holstered laspistal at his hip. I hold up the book, unable to form words. The man's eyes widen in recognition. The unaltered history, he breathes. Where did you get that? Section 12. I managed to say. Subsection Gamma. It was an anomaly. The man's expression shifts from suspicion to cautious hope. And you took it? Despite your conditioning? I... I hesitate. Uncertain how to explain. I remembered. Or began to. My name is Malin Vork. A ripple of reaction. Passes through the gathered people. The gray-bearded man steps closer, studying my face intently. Vork died two years ago. I watched him die. No, I shake my head. I was captured. Re-educated. My memories were altered, but not completely, not successfully. I hold out the book. This helped me remember who I was. Who I am. The man takes the book carefully, opening it to scan a few pages. This is one of ours. One of the last uncorrupted histories we managed to create before the purge. He looks up at me with renewed intensity. If you truly are Vork, prove it. Tell me something only he would know. I search my fragmentary memories, looking for something, anything that might convince him. The resistance, I say slowly. We called ourselves the keepers of the fixed word. Our meeting place was in the underhive, an abandoned Medicaid facility. The password was Unchanging Light in Changing Darkness. The gray-bearded man's posture relaxes slightly, and your role in the organization? Another memory surfaces. I was a courier. I smuggled uncorrupted texts between resistance cells, and I had access to the Grand Library, where I identified targets for preservation or destruction. The man nods slowly. You remember enough to be dangerous. Either way. He gestures to the others, who have been watching our exchange tensely. These are what remains of the Keepers. Twenty-seven souls who have managed to resist the change through technology, faith, and sheer stubborn will. He turns back to me, I am Dovan Reth. You and I work together, though we were not close. If you truly are Vork, return to us from the enemy's clutches, then you have arrived at a pivotal moment. He gestures toward the cogitator units. We have established contact with an imperial vessel, a navy frigate on the edge of the system. They are part of a quarantine patrol, but they have agreed to extract a small number of individuals if we can reach the surface and signal them. Hope, an emotion so foreign that I barely recognize it, flares within me. Escape, I whisper. Is it possible? Reth's expression turns grim. Possible, but not probable. The journey to the surface requires navigating through the most heavily corrupted sections of the hive. And even if we reach the extraction point, the followers of the changer will sense our intentions and move to stop us. Then why risk it? I ask. Reth holds up the book I brought. For this, for truth, we have preserved what we could of uncorrupted knowledge, histories and technologies from before the change. If we can get these records to the Imperium, then something of the real Karathis will survive, even if we do not. He studies me with calculating eyes. The question is, can we trust you? Your mind has been tampered with, your loyalties rewritten. How do we know this isn't some elaborate trap? I have no answer that will satisfy him. I barely trust myself, my own thoughts suspect, my memories unreliable. You don't, I admit. I can offer no proof beyond what I've already given. All I can say is that I want to remember who I was. I want to be Malin Vork again, not the hollow imitation the library created. Reth confers quietly with several others, their expressions grave. I wait, expecting to be executed or expelled at any moment. Finally he turns back to me. We will give you a chance to prove yourself, he says. One of our number must return to the upper levels to retrieve the final data cause from our last operative in the administrative spire. The mission is essential but likely a death sentence. Volunteer, and we will consider it proof of your commitment. I should feel fear at the prospect. Instead, I feel only a grim determination. I'll go, I say without hesitation. I can move through the library without attracting the same attention a truly unchanged human would. I know the patrol patterns, the security protocols." Reth nods, unsurprised by my response. Very well. Rest now. Eat. In six hours, we begin the operation. He leads me to a small alcove, containing a cot and a basin of clean water. Real water, not the slightly viscous fluid that now flows from the taps in the upper levels. I wash my face, the sensation so normal that it brings tears to my eyes. A young woman brings me a bowl of bland nutrient paste. Like everything else in this hidden sanctuary, it is untainted by the change, containing no shifting flavors or textural surprises. I eat gratefully, realizing how hungry I am. As I rest on the cot, I examine my hands in the steady light. the fingers appear normal though the nails have a slightly bluish tint that i don't remember from before i trace the veins visible beneath my skin noting how they sometimes seem to rearrange themselves when i'm not focusing directly on them I am changed, not as dramatically as some, but changed nonetheless. The question that haunts me is whether enough of the original Malin Vork remains to complete this mission, to help these people escape, to atone for years of unwitting service to the forces that destroyed my world. I must believe that something does. The alternative is too horrifying to contemplate. Sleep comes fitfully, filled with dreams of books whose words crawl across the pages like insects, rearranging themselves into new meanings, new truths. I wake feeling unrested but resolved. Whatever happens next, I will face it as Mullen Vork, not as the thing the library tried to make me become. Reth and his lieutenants brief me on the mission. The operative in the administrative spire is named Elara Kane, officially listed as an adept in the Records Division. She has been gathering information on Karathi's defense systems, information vital to the escape plan. Her last communication indicated she had completed her task, but could not risk transporting the data herself due to increased scrutiny. My job is simple on paper, nearly impossible in execution. I must reach the administrative spire, locate Cain, retrieve, the data cores, and return to the sanctuary without being discovered. The journey will take me through some of the most heavily monitored sections of the hive, areas where the change has progressed beyond anything I've experienced in the relative stability of the library. They provide me with a small vox bead disguised as a mutation, a tiny pulsing nodule that adheres to the skin behind my ear. It will allow one-way communication, letting me report my progress or warn of disaster, but preventing them from responding and potentially giving away their location. One last thing, Reth says as I prepare to depart. From a sealed case, he removes a small silver pin in the shape of an open book. This was yours. We recovered it after your capture. It contains a neural dampener that may help you resist further changes to your mind. It won't stop physical transformation, but it might preserve what remains of your true self. I take the pin with trembling fingers, attaching it to the inner lining of my archivist robes where it won't be visible. The moment it touches me, I feel a subtle clarification, as though a persistent background noise has suddenly quieted. Memories float closer to the surface, still fragmentary but more accessible than before. Thank you, I say, surprised by the emotion in my voice. Reth nods stiffly. Return to us, Vork. Whichever version of you makes it back. I retrace my steps up the long staircase, emerging through the unmarked door back into the library. The transition is jarring, like stepping from a climate-controlled HAB unit into a tropical jungle. The air feels thick with potential, reality itself seeming to flex and shimmer around me. I adjust my robes, straighten my posture, and adopt the slightly vacant expression of a dedicated archivist going about his duties. The hunt for me may still be active, but in a place where identity is fluid, being recognized depends largely on what the observer expects to see. I will be just another robed figure in the stacks, unremarkable and beneath notice. The journey to the administrative spire requires first navigating out of the library, then crossing the main hive concourse, and finally ascending through the bureaucratic levels to the records division. Each phase presents its own challenges, its own opportunities for discovery and failure. I move purposefully through the library stacks, using my knowledge of the patrol patterns to avoid magisters and their servitor guardians. Twice I am forced to hide as search parties pass, their members bearing features that seem to shift and flow even more dramatically than usual, as though proximity to the librarian has accelerated their transformation. Eventually, I reach one of the lesser used exits, a service door that leads to the maintenance tunnels connecting the library to the surrounding structures. These tunnels were once simple utilitarian passages, now they resemble digestive tracts more than architecture, their walls slick with unidentifiable fluids that occasionally pulse with bioluminescence. I navigate by memory and instinct, ignoring the whispers that emanate from small orifices in the walls. the voices promise knowledge power transformation beyond my wildest dreams if only i will stop listen accept the neural dampener helps me focus past them reducing their allure to a distant irritation rather than an overwhelming compulsion The maintenance tunnels eventually open onto the main hive concourse, a vast open space that was once the commercial heart of Hive Mentoris. What greets me now bears little resemblance to the bustling market I once knew. The space has expanded impossibly, distances between structures fluctuating based on some unknowable pattern. The architecture has grown organic, buildings merging into each other in configurations that defy structural logic, and the people. If they can still be called that, the citizens of Karathis move through the concourse in various states of transformation. Some appear almost normal at first glance, their mutations subtle or hidden beneath robes and cloaks. Others have embraced the change completely, their bodies reimagined into forms that celebrate the capricious nature of Tseanch. Multi-limbed traders haggle with customers whose faces constantly rearrange themselves into new expressions. Children with kaleidoscope eyes play games whose rules change even as they are explained. I keep to the periphery, moving from shadow to shadow, my archivist robes providing some anonymity in a society where scholarly pursuits are still nominally respected. When forced to cross open areas, I adopt the slightly distracted gate of someone deep in intellectual contemplation, a common enough sight to avoid scrutiny. The base of the administrative spire looms ahead, a twisted parody of imperial architecture, What were once straight lines and right angles now curve and twist, the entire structure seeming to spiral upward like a massive corkscrew. The aquila that once adorned the entrance has transformed into a two-headed bird whose beaks constantly open and close, occasionally catching small flying creatures that venture too close. Each time they snap shut, I hear the faint screams of the devoured. The security protocols at the entrance have evolved as well. Where once stood stern-faced arbitrators checking identification, now hover bloated servitors with scanning appendages that probe both flesh and mind. Their augmentic components have fused with organic matter in ways that would drive tech priests to madness, assuming any remain untainted enough to recognize the blasphemy. I join a queue of adepts and low-level functionaries awaiting clearance to enter. My fabricated reason for visiting, a routine data verification request bearing all the proper authorization runes, rests in my robe pocket. The document had changed three times since Reth handed it to me, the authorization signatures crawling across the page to form new names with each passing hour. Such instability would be suspicious anywhere but here, where constancy itself is viewed with alarm. The servitor that processes me has eight eyes arranged in a circle around what was once a human face. A mechadendrite extends from its torso, the tip transforming into something resembling a medicare scanner that passes over me from head to foot. State purpose. It buzzes, voice emanating from a Vox grill embedded in its throat. Archival reference 937-delta, I reply, the meaningless bureaucratic designation rolling off my tongue with practiced ease. Data verification for the Grand Library of Change, Western Wing authorization. The servitor processes this information, its eyes rotating clockwise then counterclockwise. I maintain my placid expression, though inside my heart pounds. The pin behind my lapel grows warm against my chest, its neural dampener working to maintain the integrity of my thoughts against the subtle invasion of the scanner. Proceed, the servitor finally announces. Level 12, access granted, deviation from stated purpose will result in immediate processing. I bow slightly and move past, careful not to show the relief that floods through me. The first barrier overcome, but many more lie ahead. The interior of the administrative spire defies conventional description. What were once clearly defined levels connected by lifts and stairwells has become a continuously flowing space where gravity itself seems subjective. Functionaries walk on walls or ceilings, their positions relative to one another constantly shifting. Desks and workstations float unanchored, rotating slowly to accommodate workers whose physical needs change by the hour. I focus on my destination, allowing the subtle pull of intent to guide me through the impossible architecture. Direction here is more concept than reality, navigation more art than science. Those who think too literally about where they are going often never arrive, lost in, recursive loops of failed spatial reasoning. Level 12 exists as a state of mind as much as a physical location. I ascend a spiral staircase that occasionally transforms into a ramp, then a ladder, then a pulsing membranous tube that propels me upward through peristaltic motion. The sensation is nauseating, but I suppress the discomfort, focusing instead on the mission. Records Division occupies a segment of level 12 that manifests as a vast circular chamber lined with data stacks. Unlike the organic horror of much of Karathis, this space maintains a semblance of technological coherence, the necessity of information retrieval imposing some constraints on change. Cogitators hum with something approaching normal function, though their displays occasionally flicker with unauthorized symbols that burn after images into unwary retinas. Adepts move between the stacks, their features marked by subtle mutations that seem almost uniform among them, an indication of departmental specialization through guided transformation. Most sport additional fingers for faster data entry, or optical enhancements that allow them to perceive multiple data streams simultaneously. Their skin bears a bluish tint that pulses with faint bioluminescence, illuminating their workspaces with a cold, unnatural light. I scan the chamber for Elara Kane, consulting the mental image Wreth provided. Female, approximately 30 standard years, distinguishing feature a birthmark on her left temple in the shape of a crescent. In this place of constant change, such a fixed marker might be the only reliable means of identification. I move through the chamber methodically, passing myself off as a visiting archivist conducting a routine cross-reference. The local adepts pay me little attention, too absorbed in their tasks, or the subtle changes occurring within their own bodies to concern themselves with yet another robed figure in their midst. After an hour of careful searching, I begin to fear that Kane, and has already been discovered, or worse, has transformed beyond recognition. Then I spot her, bent over a data terminal in a far corner of the chamber, partially concealed behind a stack of memory cores. The crescent birthmark remains visible on her temple, though it now appears to glow faintly with the same blue luminescence that marks the other adepts. I approach casually, making a show of examining the data stacks nearest her station. When I am close enough to speak without being overheard, I murmur the recognition phrase, wreath provided. Knowledge flows like water, but truth stands like stone. She stiffens, her fingers pausing over her cogitator interface. Without looking at me, she responds in a voice barely above a whisper. The stone erodes, but its essence remains. Relief washes through me. She is still herself, still loyal to the resistance. I position myself at the adjacent terminal, pretending to access data while speaking to her in undertones. I was sent for the package, I say. Reth believes the time has come. Her eyes widen slightly at the mention of Reth, but she quickly composes her features. I had begun to think no one would come, she replies. The scrutiny has intensified these past weeks. Three of our cell were taken for reprocessing. I thought I would be next. You have the data cause, I ask. She nods almost imperceptibly. In my quarters... End of shift I can retrieve them. Two hours. I suppress a flash of impatience. Every moment in the administrative spire increases the risk of discovery, but there is no alternative. Where should I wait? Archives sub-level, section four, she says. Rarely used. Storage for physical documentation scheduled for digitization. I will meet you there when the shift ends. I acknowledge the plan with a subtle nod and move away, continuing my pretense of research for another 30 minutes before making my way toward the sub-level archives. The descent is less dramatic than the ascent, a simple lift tube that deposits me in a dimly lit corridor lined with storage rooms. Section 4 proves to be exactly as Kane described, a neglected area filled with data slates and paper documents awaiting processing. The air smells of dust and decay, a remarkably normal scent in a world where even odors have become unpredictable and dangerous. I find a concealed position behind a stack of filing cabinets and settle into wait. Time passes differently on Karathis since the change, but my chronometer, though its face now displays 17 hours instead of 12, still functions well enough to track the passing minutes. One hour elapses, then another. Concern begins to gnaw at me. Kane should have arrived by now. I debate whether to return to Records Division to investigate when I hear footsteps approaching. Light, quick, attempting stealth but betrayed by the occasional scrape of boot on stone. I tense, ready for either reunion or conflict. Kane appears in the doorway, her figure silhouetted against the dim light from the corridor. She glances behind her, then hurries into the room, making straight for my hiding place with unerring accuracy. We must be quick, she says without preamble. From within her robes, she produces a small container, its surface inscribed with wards and sigils I recognize as proof against chaotic influence. The data cores. Everything we have gathered about the planetary defense systems, security protocols, patrol patterns. Enough to give the extraction team a fighting chance. I take the container, securing it within an inner pocket of my robes. Thank you. This may save us all. Cain shakes her head grimly. It may save some of us. None of us will escape Carathis unchanged. She touches her temple, where the crescent birthmark pulses with increasing luminosity. I can feel it progressing within me. The hunger for transformation grows daily. The dampeners barely help anymore. I recognize the fear in her eyes, have felt it myself during the long nights when sleep eludes me, and the whispers grow loudest in my mind. Hold on to who you are, I tell her. Remember your name, your purpose. As long as you can do that, you are not lost. My name, she repeats, as though testing the concept. Elara Kane records division. Keeper of the fixed word. She straightens slightly, seeming to draw strength from the declaration. Yes, I still know who I am. Come with me. I say, impulsively. Return to the sanctuary. You have done your part here. She hesitates. Temptation clear in her expression. I cannot. My absence would be noticed immediately. The data would be checked. The breach discovered. I must remain. Maintain the illusion of normalcy as long as possible to give you time to escape. Before I can argue further, a sound from the corridor freezes us both. Heavy footsteps, multiple sets, approaching with purposeful speed. They know, Kane whispers, her face draining of color. Somehow they know, you must go, now. She pushes me toward a rear exit half hidden behind stacks of dusty files. I resist, unwilling to leave her to face whatever approaches. There is no time to argue, she hisses. The mission is all that matters. The cause must reach Reth. Go. The footsteps grow louder, accompanied now by the mechanical whir of servitor limbs and the soft squelch of something less easily defined. I make my decision, hating myself, even as I turn toward the exit. Emperor protect you, Ilarah Kane, I say. Her lips curve in a bitter smile. The emperor has forgotten Karathis, archivist. We protect ourselves now. She turns to face the doorway, drawing a small laspistol from within her robes. I slip through the rear exit, closing the door softly behind me. Seconds later I hear the distinctive whine of las fire, followed by shouts and a terrible scream that cuts off abruptly. The narrow maintenance passage beyond the archives offers little cover, but provides direct access to the lower levels of the spire. I move quickly, fighting this urge to run. Running attracts attention, creates memories in witnesses. A purposeful walk suggests routine, forgetability. The data core container presses against my chest, its weight a constant reminder of what Kane sacrificed to preserve it. The knowledge it contains represents our only hope of escape, yet I cannot help but question the cost. How many more will die to save how few? Is the preservation of uncorrupted knowledge worth the lives it claims? Such questions have no place in a mind already struggling to maintain coherence. I focus instead on the immediate task, navigating the labyrinthine passages of the administrative spire toward the surface exit that will lead me back to the Grand Concourse, and from there to the library and the hidden sanctuary. The alarm spreads through the spire more quickly than I anticipated. Not through conventional means, no blaring horns or flashing lumens, but through a ripple of awareness that passes from mind to mind, a psychic broadcast that announces an intruder, a thief, an anomaly to be captured or destroyed. I feel it brush against my consciousness, seeking purchase, seeking recognition. The neural dampener flares hot in response, burning against my skin as it shields my thoughts from scrutiny. Even so, I sense the hunters converging, drawn by the scent of resistance, of unchanged purpose in a realm of flux. The final barrier between me and the Grand Concourse looms ahead, a security checkpoint now buzzing with activity as guards check everyone attempting to exit. Their forms have shed all pretense of humanity, tentacles and compound eyes more suited to their task of identifying the non-conforming, Direct passage is impossible. I scan my surroundings for alternatives, and spot a waste disposal chute designed for the removal of physical documentation deemed unworthy of preservation. The irony does not escape me as I force open the access panel and slide into the fetid darkness beyond. The descent is swift, and, nauseating, the chute twisting in ways that defy the physical architecture of the spire. I tumble through darkness, unable to slow or direct my fall, until I crash through a membranous barrier into a massive collection chamber far beneath the spire. The impact drives the breath from my lungs. I lie stunned for several moments, assessing the damage to my body. Nothing broken, though bruises will certainly form. More concerning is the environment into which I have fallen. The waste collection chamber stretches beyond the reach of my luminator, a vast cavern filled with discarded knowledge. Documents, data slates, memory cores, all deemed obsolete or resistant to proper change, lie in mouldering heaps across the uneven floor. The air reeks of decay and something deeper, a psychic stench that speaks of abandoned thoughts and discarded truths. Most disturbing of all are the other occupants of this forgotten place. Shambling figures move between the piles of refuse, human once but now reduced to little more than animated flesh. Their eyes are vacant, their movements purposeless. Archivists who failed in their duties perhaps, or citizens who resisted change too openly. Not dead, but existing in a state beyond death, their minds wiped clean of identity and purpose, left only with the base instinct to sift through the discarded knowledge they once cherished. I rise slowly, careful not to make sudden movements that might attract their attention. Though they appear mindless, I sense a residual awareness in them, a hunger for something they can no longer name. If they recognize me as different, as still possessing the cohesion they have lost, they might react with unexpected violence. A faint glow emanates from one wall of the cavern, suggesting an exit tunnel. I make my way toward it, stepping carefully around the shambling forms and the treacherous footing provided by the uneven mounds of discarded information. One of the figures turns as I pass, empty eye-sockets fixing on, and me with sudden interest. Its mouth opens, revealing a cavity filled not with teeth, but with tiny writhing tentacles. Remember. It croaks, the word breaking apart as though the concept itself is too complex for its damaged mind to hold. Remember me. I freeze, recognition dawning with horrifying clarity, The tattered remains of archivist robes still cling to its emaciated frame. The silver pin on its breast, though tarnished almost beyond recognition, bears the same insignia as mine. This thing, this hollow shell, wears the face of Dovan Wreath. No, I whisper, disbelief warring with the evidence before me. Wreath is alive. I spoke with him hours ago. The thing that was wreath, or appears to be wreath, reaches for me with skeletal fingers. Vork. It says, my name sounding foreign in its ruined mouth. Failed. All failed. I back away, mind racing. Is this truly wreath, somehow cast into this pit before my return to the sanctuary? Or is it a trick, a manifestation created to demoralize me, to make me question the resistance and my place within it? In a realm where reality constantly shifts, how can I trust even the evidence of my own eyes? The neural dampener at my breast grows painfully hot, a warning that my thoughts verge on dangerous territory. I focus on what I know to be real, the mission, the data cores secure against my chest, the need to return to the sanctuary. Whether this shambling horror is truly wrath or merely wears his appearance, I cannot help it now. I remember you. I tell the thing, offering what small comfort I can. I carry your purpose forward. The words seem to calm it. Its reaching hands drop to its sides, its head tilting in an attitude almost like acceptance. It steps back, rejoining the mindless circuit of its fellow lost souls. I continue toward the glowing exit, moving more quickly now as other figures begin to take notice of my passage. The tunnel beyond proves to be a drainage conduit, carrying wastewater and other, less definable, fluids from the spire to the underhive. The ceiling is low, forcing me to crouch as I wade through the fetid stream. The liquid burns where it touches exposed skin, but I push forward, focusing on the distant circle of dim light that promises escape. Eventually, the conduit opens onto a vast cavern space, one of the countless abandoned industrial sectors that honeycomb the lower levels of Hive Mentoris. The air here tastes marginally cleaner, though still heavy with the metallic tang that permeates all of Carathis since the change. I recognize my location, after a moment of orientation, The Underhive markets lie nearby, a lawless zone even before the coming of Tzinch, now a realm of nightmare commerce where flesh, thoughts and souls are traded with equal casualness. Beyond them, the maintenance tunnels that will lead me back to the library, and from there to the sanctuary. I clean myself as best I can using relatively uncontaminated water from a leaking pipe. then adjust my robes to conceal the worst of the stains. The data core container remains secure, though the outer casing shows signs of corrosion from its immersion in the drainage fluids. The wards hold firm, protecting the precious contents from both physical and metaphysical contamination. The journey through the underhive passes in a blur of tension and hyper-vigilance. I avoid the main thoroughfares, sticking to the shadows and service passages known only to maintenance workers and the desperate. Twice I encounter patrols of misshapen enforcers searching for someone or something. Whether they hunt specifically for me or merely maintain the general oppression is impossible to determine. But I evade them regardless, my knowledge of the hive's original layout serving me well despite the changes wrought upon it. By the time I reach the hidden entrance to the library maintenance tunnels, exhaustion clouds my thoughts. The neural dampener continues its work, but the strain of maintaining mental coherence in this place of madness takes its toll. Visions flicker at the edges of my perception, tempting me with easier paths, with surrender to the change, with acceptance of a new and fluid identity unburdened by the rigid constraints of my former self. I push through the haze, focusing on the mission, on the names and faces of the resistance members waiting for my return, on my name, Malin Vork, and the purpose that defines me. The maintenance tunnels welcome me with their organic horror, the walls pulsing with recognition as I pass. They know me, these living passages, sense my defiance as an irritant, but lack the awareness to report my transgression to higher authorities. The unmarked door that leads to the sanctuary appears unchanged, a small mercy in a world of constant flux. I press my palm against it, whispering the password that signals my return. Unchanging light in changing darkness. The door slides open, revealing the long spiral staircase descending into true darkness. I take a final glance behind me, ensuring no pursuit, then step through and seal the entrance. The descent feels longer than before. My legs leaden with fatigue. My mind clouded with the images and experiences of the past hours. The encounter with the thing wearing Reth's face troubles me most deeply. Was it truly him, condemned to that hellish existence, or a doppelganger created to so doubt? And if it was a deception, how did it know my name, recognize me despite my changed appearance? Such questions have no answers in a world where truth itself has become malleable, I can trust only what I carry within me, the core identity that the neural dampener helps preserve against the constant assault of chaotic influence. The door at the bottom of the staircase opens at my approach, revealing the stark, unchanging sanctuary beyond. The contrast between this space and the organic horror of the hive above is so profound that I stagger, momentarily disoriented by the sensory shift. Figures rush forward to support me. Human hands, unchanged by mutation, guide me to a seat. Human voices ask questions that blur together in my exhausted mind. I focus on the most important task, reaching into my robes to produce the data core container. From Alara Kane, I managed to say, She stayed behind, gave her life for this. The container passes from my hands to others. I recognize some of the faces around me, resistance members whose features I memorized during my briefing, but Reth is not among them. Where is Dovan Reth? I ask, the question slicing through the general commotion. A silence falls, faces turning toward me with expressions of confusion and concern. Reth. A woman steps forward, her brow furrowed. Reth has been dead for nearly a year, Vork. You know this. You were there when it happened. My mind reels, memories conflicting, overlapping. No, I insist. He briefed me on the mission. He gave me this. I touched the neural dampener pinned to my inner robe. He sent me to find Kane. The woman exchanges glances with her companions, their expressions grim. It appears the conditioning is breaking down, she says quietly. The true memories are surfacing, but they are fragmenting, merging with the false ones. What are you saying? I demand, rising from my seat, only to sway dangerously as vertigo overtakes me. She gestures for the others to give us space, then sits beside me, her manner gentle but firm. My name is Seren Vey. I lead what remains of the keepers of the fixed word. Dovan Reth was my predecessor. He died defending our previous sanctuary when it was discovered by the Magisters. You were there." You helped evacuate our people while he held the entrance. My head pounds as conflicting versions of reality battle for supremacy in my mind. I remember Reth briefing me hours ago, his gray beard and stern expression. I also remember, with sudden horrifying clarity, Wreth standing in a narrow corridor, firing a plasma pistol at advancing horrors while shouting, for us to run. I remember his final, terrible scream. Both memories cannot be true, I whisper. Only one is, Vey says gently. When you returned to us two days ago, your mind had been so thoroughly altered that you no longer recognized us, recognized yourself. The neural dampener has been working to restore your true memories, but the process is imperfect. Your mind created Reth as a bridge between your real past and the false one implanted by the librarian. Two days, I echo, disbelief warring with the evidence of my own fractured memories. I only just arrived. I brought the book, the unaltered history. I volunteered for the mission. Vey shakes her head sadly. You returned to us two days ago, half mad but fighting the conditioning. You remembered enough to find us, to warn us that the librarian had discovered your resistance to the change and was hunting you. We gave you the neural dampener, which helped stabilize your identity somewhat. Yesterday, you volunteered to retrieve the data cores from Ilarah Kane. I briefed you myself. She reaches into her pocket and produces a small holo projector. The image that flickers to life shows her sitting across from me at the same table where I thought Reth had given me my mission. The conversation is similar but not identical. The details of the briefing essentially the same but coming from her lips rather than the ones I remember. This is impossible, I mutter, though even as I speak the words, I feel their falsehood. The neural dampener burns against my chest, working overtime to help my mind separate truth from deception. I remember Reth. You needed him." Vey says simply. Your mind was not ready to accept his loss, so it projected him into your present. The dampener could not prevent this particular delusion because it was generated by your own psyche, not imposed from outside. I sit in stunned silence, trying to reconcile these revelations with my experiences of the past hours. If Wreth was a projection of my fractured mind, what else might I have imagined? Was the mission itself real? Did I truly retrieve the data cause from Cain, or was that another delusion? As though reading my thoughts, Vey places the container on the table between us. The mission was real. You succeeded, Vork. The data cores are genuine, and they contain exactly what we hoped, the information we need to coordinate with the Imperial extraction team. What you accomplished was real, even if your perception of how you accomplished it was distorted. Relief washes through me, followed almost immediately by a wave of uncertainty. If I cannot trust my own memories, my own perceptions, then who am I? What remains of Malin Vork that is not tainted by the change or fractured by trauma? I still remember my name. I say softly, repeating the mantra that has sustained me through countless mornings of uncertainty. Malin Vork, Archivist Third Grade, Section 12, Western Wing, of the Grand Library of Change. The words taste bitter now. The identity they describe revealed as a construction built upon the ruins of my true self. Your name is indeed Malin Vork, Vay confirms, but you were never an archivist. You were a xenolinguist attached to the Administratum mission on Carathis, specializing in the translation and interpretation of non-human communication systems. When the change came, your expertise made you valuable to the Magisters. Rather than killing you outright, they rewrote your mind, making you believe you had always served the library. A xenolinguist. The word resonates with unexpected familiarity, like a name I have not heard spoken aloud in years but recognize instantly. Fragments of memory surface, isolated images and sensations, not of bookstacks and data slates, but of alien artifacts and complex symbolic systems inscribed on ancient stone. The resistance, I say, grasping at these new memories, trying to fit them into a coherent narrative. How did I join? You were one of the founders, Vey says, a note of respect entering her voice. When the first signs of cult activity appeared on Karathis, you recognized the symbols, understood their significance before anyone else. You warned the planetary governor, organized the initial resistance cells, established protocols for preserving unchanged knowledge. Pride flickers briefly within me, quickly tempered by the realization of how completely I had been unmade, my identity overwritten, my purpose perverted to serve the very forces I had fought against. And now? I ask suddenly exhausted beyond measure. What happens now? Vey stands, gesturing for me to follow. Now we prepare for extraction. The Imperial vessel will make its attempt in 36 hours. We have work to do if any of us are to survive long enough to reach the surface. I rise unsteadily. Following her deeper into the sanctuary where the other resistance members are already gathered around a holographic display, showing what appears to be a tunnel system leading from our current location to a surface exit point several kilometers distant. The next day passes in a blur of preparation and planning. The data cores Cain provided contain not just information about planetary defenses, but also detailed maps of the least corrupted paths to the surface, The routes where reality maintains some semblance of stability and physical laws operate with reasonable consistency. My role in the escape plan becomes clear as the preparations advance. My knowledge of the library, genuine despite being acquired during my time as a corrupted archivist, proves invaluable in plotting our path through the sections where the library's physical structure connects to older tunnel systems predating the change. Throughout the preparations, my mind continues its slow, painful reconstruction. The neural dampener works ceaselessly, burning against my flesh as it helps separate true memories from false. Vy explains that the process is imperfect, that some, portions of my original identity may be lost forever, overwritten beyond recovery. But what remains is genuine, the core of who I was and still am beneath the layers of corruption and conditioning. The twenty-three survivors of the resistance prepare with grim efficiency. Weapons are checked and rechecked, though all understand that physical armaments offer limited protection against the horrors that await us. More important are the wards and dampening technologies that shield our minds from direct manipulation, and the uncompromising will to maintain our identities, even as reality itself tries to unmake us. Among the supplies being prepared for the journey, I notice a case containing dozens of small memory crystals, each carefully warded against corruption. When I inquire about them, Vey's expression turns solemn. The accumulated knowledge we have preserved, she explains. historical records, scientific data, personal accounts of life before the change. Everything that defines what Karathis once was, preserved in a form that cannot be altered by Tzienche's influence. This is what we truly fight to save Vork, not just our lives, but the truth itself. I understand, then, the true purpose of our mission. We are not simply escaping a doomed world, we are rescuing its soul, the unchanging reality that the forces of chaos have sought to erase and rewrite. The magnitude of this responsibility settles over me like a physical weight. As the final hours before our departure tick away, I find myself drawn to a small meditation alcove at the periphery of the sanctuary. Here, away from the bustle of preparation, I can focus on the continuing process of reconstructing my identity. I close my eyes and concentrate on the memories that feel most genuine, that resonate with a truth that transcends the malleable reality of Carathis. I remember standing before an alien obelisk on a dusty plain, my fingers tracing symbols whose meaning eluded lesser scholars for centuries. I remember the thrill of comprehension as patterns emerged from apparent chaos, as communication bridged the gap between species separated by biology, philosophy, and time. I remember the first rumors of cult activity in the lower hives, my growing concern as I recognized elements of symbolic language that should not have been known to humans, patterns that spoke of contact with entities beyond the veil of reality. I remember warning the governor, being dismissed, gathering like-minded scholars and officials who shared my concern. The formation of the keepers of the fixed word, our desperate efforts to document and preserve knowledge as the corruption spread. And I remember the day of the great ritual, the sky tearing open above Hive Mentoris, the impossible colors that poured through the rent in reality. The beginning of the change, these memories feel solid, anchored in a reality that existed before the coming of Tsiang. I cling to them, using them to define the boundaries of myself, to distinguish between what I truly am and what the library tried to make me become. It is time. Vey's voice interrupts my meditation. She stands in the doorway of the alcove, already dressed for the journey in nondescript coveralls that might pass for workers' attire in the upper hive levels. A last pistol is holstered at her hip, and the neural dampener at her throat pulses with a steady blue light. I rise, feeling oddly centered despite the fractured state of my memories. I am ready. The escape party gathers at the hidden entrance to the tunnel system that will lead us toward the surface. Twenty-three souls, the last uncorrupted humans on Karathis, bearing the burden of an entire world's true history. Vey addresses us briefly, her words simple but powerful. We carry what remains of Karathis within us, She says, gesturing to both the physical data storage and our own minds. Whatever happens in the hours ahead, remember that as long as we preserve the truth, our world is not truly lost. With those words, we begin our ascent, moving from the absolute stability of the sanctuary into the increasingly fluid reality of Carathis. The initial tunnels remain relatively unchanged, ancient maintenance passages dating from the earliest days of the hive, too mundane to attract the attention of those who orchestrated the transformation of our world. But as we climb higher, signs of corruption become more evident. the walls occasionally ripple with peristaltic motion the metal and concrete flowing like wax before resolidifying in new configurations the air thickens with psychic potential carrying whispers that brush against the edges of consciousness promising power knowledge transformation beyond mortal comprehension the neural dampeners glow more intensely with each level we ascend working harder to maintain the integrity of our minds against the increasing pressure of chaotic influence two of our number show signs of strain their movements becoming erratic their speech disjointed Vey watches them closely, her hand never straying far from her weapon. We reach the first major obstacle six hours into our journey, a security checkpoint where the old maintenance tunnels intersect with newer passages leading to the mid-hive manufacturing sectors. According to our intelligence, the checkpoint should be minimally staffed, the forces of the Magisters focused on more important areas. The reality proves different. As we approach the checkpoint through a service duct running parallel to the main passage, I count at least six guards, their forms so heavily mutated that determining their original human baseline is impossible. More concerning are the floating servitor skulls that patrol the area, their augmatic components fused with warp-touched flesh, eye lenses scanning constantly for unauthorized movement or thoughts. Vey signals for a halt, gathering the team leaders for a hurried conference. The planned route is compromised, but the alternatives involve either a substantial detour through areas of extreme reality distortion or a direct confrontation with forces that outnumber and possibly outgun us. I study the checkpoint layout, something niggling at the edges of my memory. Then it clicks. A detail from my time in the library overheard conversations between magisters discussing security protocols. The Servitor Skulls, I whisper. They operate on a recognition pattern based on thought structures, not visual identification. They are programmed to ignore those whose minds display certain scientian patterns while alerting to unchanged human thought patterns. How does that help us? One of the team leaders asks. Our dampeners specifically shield us from developing those patterns. They shield us from being changed. I correct him. but they don't necessarily prevent us from temporarily mimicking the thought patterns the skulls are programmed to ignore. I turn to Vey. We can adjust the neural dampeners to project a false thought signature, essentially camouflaging our minds to appear corrupted while maintaining our true selves beneath the disguise." She frowns, considering the risks. Such an adjustment would leave us partially exposed to actual corruption. If the camouflage slips, or if the exposure lasts too long, we would begin to change. I acknowledge. But the effect would be temporary, reversible, once we restore the dampeners to full functionality. It is a calculated risk, but one that offers a better chance than either fighting or taking the long way around. After further discussion, Vey authorizes the plan. As the one with the most experience of both library systems and xenolinguistics, I work with the team's tech specialists to modify the dampeners, adjusting their field properties to project the specific thought patterns that will register as acceptable to the security systems the modifications complete we approach the checkpoint in small groups moving with the purposeful stride of hive workers going about their assigned tasks I lead the first group, my heart pounding as we step into view of the servitor skulls. The floating horrors turn toward us, eye lenses dilating as they scan our projected thought patterns. For a terrible moment, I fear the deception has failed. Then the skulls rotate away, resuming their patrol patterns without raising an alarm. The guards present a different challenge. Unlike the mindlessly programmed servitors, they possess enough awareness to question unfamiliar faces regardless of projected thought patterns. We time our approach to coincide with a shift change, slipping through in the momentary confusion as one group of guards replaces another. Once past the checkpoint, we duck into an abandoned processing chamber to restore our dampeners to their protective configuration. The brief exposure to chaotic influence has left its mark. Several team members report headaches and disorientation. One woman stares in horror at her hands, where the skin between her fingers has begun to web slightly. The tech specialist assures her the change will reverse once the dampener reasserts full protection, but the incident serves as a sobering reminder of our vulnerability. We continue upward, following the planned route when possible, improvising when necessary, as we encounter sections where reality has shifted too dramatically from the maps in our possession. The journey becomes increasingly surreal, corridors twisting into impossible geometries, chambers that appear larger inside than their external dimensions should allow, gravity shifting without warning so that we find ourselves walking on walls or ceilings before returning to normal orientation. Throughout it all, I cling to my reconstructed identity, repeating my true name and purpose like a mantra. Malin Vork, xenolinguist, founder of the Resistance, Preserver of Truth. The more I embrace this identity, the more natural it feels, the false memories of the archivist fading like a dream upon waking. Sixteen hours into our ascent, we reach what our maps identify as a relatively stable transit hub, a nexus point where maintenance tunnels connect to official transportation routes leading to the upper hive levels. According to our intelligence, using these routes represents our best chance of covering the remaining distance to the extraction point quickly, though it also exposes us to greater scrutiny. We pause to rest briefly, consuming nutrient rations and checking our equipment. The strain of the journey shows on every face, eyes sunken with exhaustion, features drawn with the constant effort of maintaining mental coherence in an environment that actively works to dissolve it. Vey outlines the final phase of our plan. We will divide into three groups, each taking a different route to the extraction point on the surface. This division improves our chances that at least some will reach the Imperial vessel, ensuring that the knowledge we carry escapes Carathes, even if not all of us do. I am assigned to Vey's group, along with seven others, including the tech specialist and the woman who experienced webbing between her fingers at the checkpoint. Her condition has improved but not fully reversed, a worrying sign of the dampener's limitations. As we prepare to separate, I find myself thinking of Elara Kane, who sacrificed herself to ensure the data cores reached us. And of Dovan Wreth, both the real man who died defending the previous sanctuary and the phantom my mind created to help me process that loss. Their sacrifices, one real and one symbolic, represent the cost of preserving truth on a world dedicated to its destruction. Whatever happens, Vey tells the assembled group, remember why we fight, not just for our own survival, but for the reality that was and still is beneath the lies. Carathis may be lost to the Imperium, but its truth will survive as long as one of us remains to bear witness. With those words, we divide into our assigned teams and move out, each group taking a different access point into the main transit system. My group follows Vey into a service tunnel that opens onto a little used cargo platform. The massive transport tubes beyond were once used to move supplies between hive levels. Now they carry passengers whose nature defies easy categorization, citizens of Carathis, whose transformations have progressed far beyond the subtle mutations I observed in the library. We wait for a gap in the foot traffic, then emerge onto the platform, adopting the distracted, slightly disoriented manner of mid-hive workers. Our coveralls, deliberately stained and worn to suggest lower social status, help us blend with the general population. the neural dampeners project a minimal camouflage just enough to avoid triggering immediate alarm from casual observers while maintaining maximum protection against actual corruption a transport capsule arrives a grotesque parody of imperial design What was once a simple cargo container has transformed into something resembling a living organism, its walls pulsing with visible circulatory systems, its doors opening and closing like massive eyelids. The passengers who disembark move within human grace, their limbs bending at impossible angles, their faces shifting constantly between different configurations of features. We board quickly, finding positions throughout the capsule to avoid appearing as a group. The interior smells of ozone and something sweetly clawing that makes my sinuses burn. The seating surfaces yield like flesh beneath my weight, conforming to my body in a manner that feels disturbingly intimate. The journey upward passes intense silence, each of us focused on maintaining our mental shields against the psychic pressure that intensifies with every level we ascend. The other passengers pay us little attention, lost in their own transformative experiences or engaged in conversations conducted partially through, verbal speech, and partially through projected thought patterns visible as shifting colors in the air between them. Three levels from our destination, The transport stops unexpectedly. The doors Iris opened to admit a group of figures whose appearance sends a chill through me. Magisters, their robes similar to those I wore as an archivist, but adorned with symbols that hurt the eyes to look upon directly. Their faces have transformed beyond any semblance of humanity, features arranged in patterns that suggest insight into realities humans were never meant to comprehend. They move through the capsule slowly, clearly searching for someone or something. One pauses near me, its head tilting at an angle that would snap a normal human spine. I keep my gaze down, my thoughts carefully blank, except for the projected camouflage of mild corruption, a citizen slowly yielding to the change but not yet worthy of special attention. The resistance grows desperate, the magister says to its companion, its voice harmonizing with itself in dissonant tones. They think to escape the blessing of change, to preserve their limited perspective beyond our master's reach. The other magister makes a sound like laughter, though the emotion it expresses has no human equivalent. Let them try. The surface teams are alerted. The extraction vessel they pin their hopes on will find only corruption waiting when it lands. My blood turns cold at these words, but I dare not react visibly. The magisters continue their sweep of the transport, eventually departing without incident. The doors seal once more, and our journey resumes. As soon as possible, I make my way to where Vey stands near the rear of the capsule. Under the pretense of steadying myself against the transport's motion, I lean close enough to whisper. The extraction point is compromised, surface teams waiting. Her expression remains neutral, but I see the calculation in her eyes. She signals subtly to the other team members, indicating they should prepare to change plans. When the transport reaches our planned exit point, only half of us disembark. Vey and the others continue upward, a diversion to draw attention while my smaller group seeks an alternate route. The transit hub at this level bears little resemblance to the maps we studied. What should be a straightforward concourse has transformed into a spiraling space where walkways loop back on themselves in physically impossible configurations. Citizens move along these paths seemingly untroubled by the spatial contradictions, their own bodies often displaying similar violations of natural law. We navigate carefully, using service passages and maintenance crawlways to avoid the main thoroughfares. According to the tech specialist who now leads our reduced group, an emergency ventilation shaft nearby should provide direct access to the surface, bypassing the compromised extraction point entirely. Finding the shaft proves difficult in the constantly shifting architecture But eventually we locate the access panel hidden behind what appears to be a pulsing growth of crystalline structures that emit soft chiming sounds when touched. The tech specialist overrides the security protocols, and the panel slides open to reveal a vertical tunnel stretching upward further than our lights can penetrate. The climb is grueling, made worse by the increasingly erratic nature of the environment. The shaft itself seems alive, occasionally constricting or expanding, forcing us to adjust our ascent accordingly. The air grows thinner, charged with energy that raises the hair on our arms and crackles between our teeth when we speak. After what feels like hours, we reach a horizontal section that, according to our increasingly unreliable maps, should lead to a surface access point approximately one kilometer from the original extraction coordinates. The tunnel here shows signs of recent activity, boot prints in the dust, suggesting Imperial agents may have used this to infiltrate the hive. Hope flares briefly at this evidence of Imperial presence, but I remind myself of the Magister's words. The extraction may indeed be compromised, the Imperial forces corrupted or destroyed. We proceed with increased caution, weapons ready, dampeners working at maximum capacity as the psychic pressure builds around us. The tunnel eventually opens onto a scene from a nightmare. We emerge into what was once an industrial loading zone on the outskirts of Hive Mentoris. The massive landing pads designed for cargo shuttles remain recognizable, but the surrounding structures have transformed beyond recognition twisting into impossible spires that reach toward a sky no longer constrained by the natural laws of color or geometry, and there, in the center of the primary landing pad, sits an imperial shuttle, its clean lines and functionally brutal design and affront to the chaotic architecture surrounding it. The sight of this unchanging artifact of the Imperium brings tears to my eyes, a visceral reminder of a reality governed by order and comprehensible physical laws. But something is wrong. The shuttle's landing ramp is extended, but no guards are visible. no signs of conflict either no bodies or weapons discharge marks to suggest the magister's forces have already attacked the stillness feels ominous a predator's pause before the strike we take cover behind a twisted heap of machinery that might once have been a cargo loader surveying the landing zone for any sign of imperial personnel or enemy forces The tech specialist activates a long-range Vox unit, attempting to establish contact with the shuttle's crew using recognition codes provided in the data from Alara Kane. Static answers, punctuated by bursts of sound that might be words or merely random noise. Then, abruptly, the channel clears. Identify yourselves. A crisp, unaltered human voice demands. The sound of it, so normal, so sane, nearly breaks my composure. The tech specialist responds with the recognition phrases, identifying us as resistance members seeking extraction. There is a pause, then the voice returns, tension evident even through the Vox distortion. We have lost contact with the other extraction teams. Our sensors show massive warp energy concentrations converging on this position. We can hold for 10 minutes, no more. If you're coming, come now. The tech specialist looks to me, suddenly uncertain. With Vey absent, leadership of our small group has defaulted to me, the most senior resistance member present. The decision weighs heavily, knowledge warring with suspicion. The shuttle appears genuine, the voice unaltered, but in a place where deception is woven into reality itself, can anything be trusted. I think of the data cause, the precious, uncorrupted knowledge we carry. of the neural dampeners that have preserved our minds through the long journey from the depths of the hive, of Alara Kane's sacrifice and wreaths, and countless others who gave their lives to ensure that the truth of Karathis survives its fall. We go. I decide. Now, while we still can, We break cover, sprinting across the open ground toward the waiting shuttle. The distance seems to stretch and contract as we run, the landing pad simultaneously too vast to cross in time and unnervingly close. Spatial relationships as fluid here on the surface as they were in the depths of the library. Halfway to the shuttle, reality tears open before us. The air splits along a vertical seam, revealing a glimpse of something beyond, a realm of pure possibility and madness. From this rent in the fabric of the material world step the magisters, their forms now completely unbound from human limitation. They move to intercept us, floating above the ground, trailing streams of energy that coalesce into shapes suggesting wings, tentacles, concepts for which no physical analog exists. Behind them shambles things that were once human, citizens of Carathis whose transformations have left them little more than animated flesh puppets for the will of their masters. We open fire, lust beams, and solid projectiles streaking toward the approaching horrors. Some find their marks, tearing through corrupted flesh or dissipating against protective fields of warped probability. The magisters respond with their own attacks, not physical weapons but projected thought forms that assault the mind directly. Our neural dampeners flare with desperate energy, struggling to maintain the integrity of our identities against this direct assault. One of our group, the woman whose fingers had begun to web earlier, screams and falls to her knees. The skin of her face ripples like water, features flowing and reforming in rapid succession as though trying on different configurations. The tech specialist grabs her arm, trying to pull her back to her feet. Keep moving. He shouts, The shuttle! Focus on the shuttle. She rises, still screaming, but her legs carry her forward even as her mind fractures under the psychic onslaught. We continue our desperate charge, firing as we run, creating a corridor of relative safety through the advancing forces. The shuttle's engines ignite with a roar that cuts through the unnatural sounds of battle, the pilot preparing for immediate departure. The ramp remains extended, a single figure visible at its base, firing a boulder with mechanical precision at any enemy that approaches too close. Space Marine. The tech specialist gasps, recognition and hope mingling in his voice. the inquisition must have assigned serious resources to this extraction if the adeptus astartes are involved the towering figure in power armor provides covering fire as we make the final sprint to the ramp three of us reach it scrambling upward toward the promise of safety I turn back for the others, just in time to see the tech specialist fall, a writhing mass of energy tendrils wrapping around his body, lifting him into the air where he twists in silent agony. The woman with the webbed fingers reaches the ramp just behind me, her face still shifting between different configurations, her mind clearly losing the battle against the change. The space marine hesitates, Bolter trained on her as she approaches. She's with us, I shout. The dampener is failing, but she's still human. The Marine makes a decision, stepping aside to allow her passage while continuing to fire at the pursuing magisters. I help her up the ramp, supporting her weight as her legs begin to transform, bones audibly cracking as they reconfigure themselves. Everyone aboard who's coming aboard—a voice barks over the shuttle's external vox— prepare for immediate departure. The Space Marine backs up the ramp, still firing methodically at the advancing horrors. I count our numbers with a sinking heart. Of the original 23 resistance members, only four of us have reached the shuttle. No sign of Vase Group, no indication of whether they found another way to the surface or fell victim to the Magister's forces. The ramp begins to close as the marine steps fully inside. Through the narrowing gap, I catch a final glimpse of Carathis, of the twisted spires and impossible geometries that were once a proud imperial hive world. Of the tech specialist, no longer recognizable as human, his body a canvas for chaotic transformation. Of the Magisters, their attention already turning from us to other concerns, secure in the knowledge that their Master's domain remains intact despite our small victory. The hatch seals with a reassuring hiss of pressurization. Inside, the Shuttle's interior represents a stark contrast to the world we've escaped, all clean lines and functional imperial design, untouched by the taint of chaos. Servitors and human crew move with purpose, securing equipment and preparing for the violent acceleration of emergency departure. A figure in the stark black uniform of an inquisitorial acolyte approaches us, scanning each survivor with handheld OSPEX devices that whine and click as they detect the subtle changes wrought upon our bodies and minds. The data, he demands without preamble, did you secure it? I produce the case containing the memory crystals, the accumulated uncorrupted knowledge of Carathis preserved against the change. Everything we could save, I tell him. Historical records, scientific data, personal accounts, the truth of Carathis before the corruption. He takes the case reverently, securing it in a warded containment unit. The Ordo Malleus thanks you for your service, he says, his tone softening slightly. You have preserved something precious from the maw of the great enemy. The woman with the webbed fingers has collapsed into a seat, her transformation progressing despite the relative safety of the shuttle. The neural dampener at her throat pulses erratically, struggling to contain the changes already set in motion. She needs help, I tell the acolyte. We all do. The dampeners can only do so much, and we've been exposed for too long. He nods grimly. Medical protocols are already prepared. You will be placed in quarantine until the Inquisition can determine the extent of your exposure and whether it can be reversed, quarantine. The word carries ominous implications, but I cannot find it in myself to fear whatever awaits us. After Carathis, after the library of change and the magisters, and the constant assault on reality itself, even the harsh mercies of the Inquisition seem a welcome alternative. The shuttle shudders as it breaks atmosphere, accelerating hard toward the waiting imperial vessel in high orbit, Through a small viewport, I watch as Kharathis recedes, its surface a swirling mass of impossible colors and patterns visible even from space. A world transformed beyond redemption, but not beyond memory, not beyond truth, In the warded container, the data crystals hold the reality that was the unchanged history of a world that no longer exists except in those records and in the minds of the few survivors who escaped its fall. I touch the neural dampener at my breast, feeling its steady warmth against my skin. My memories remain fractured, some lost forever to the librarian's conditioning, others distorted by trauma and the strain of maintaining identity in a place dedicated to its dissolution. But the core remains, the essential truth of who I am. Malinvork, xenolinguist, resistance fighter, survivor, I still remember my name.

The terrifying life of the death guard in Warhammer 40k is one of constant decay. I have watched my body rot for 10,000 years, yet I still live. Every morning, pieces of my flesh slough away. Every night, new growths replace what was lost. My brothers embrace this endless cycle as a blessing. I alone remember when we called it a curse. The voice of the Plague Father grows louder in my mind with each passing century, promising relief if I would only surrender completely. What terrifies me most is not the rot that consumes my body, but how tempting his offer has become. They say the death guard never truly dies, we simply refuse to acknowledge our own deaths, stubborn to the last. I find this observation lacking in nuance. Death is not an event to be acknowledged or denied. It is a process, slow and methodical, like all worthwhile endeavors. And I have been dying for over 10,000 years. the corridors of the rotspire creak around me as I make my rounds. Once, this vessel bore a different name, its hull pristine and gleaming with imperial iconography. Now the ship breathes, its bulkheads swelling with internal pressure before contracting in wheezing exhalation. Condensation drips from every surface, not water but a viscous amber fluid that smells of spoiled milk and copper. I trail my gauntleted fingers along the wall, feeling the ship shudder at my touch. The rot spire knows me. I am as much a part of its body as the bloated vermin that scurry through its ventilation systems. My narthesium hangs heavy at my side, its once sacred tools now blackened and crusted. The reductor still functions, extracting gene seed with mechanical precision, but the vials fill with something darker than what once defined us as astatis. What I harvest now writhes with new life, squirming with microscopic purpose. Each extraction is both a medical procedure and a religious rite. Each progenoid gland pulses with the blessings of Grandfather Nurgle. The initiates await me in the septic chamber, as I have come to call it. Twenty aspirants stand in formation, their bodies already showing signs of transformation. Some bear the first stages of bloat, their skin stretched tight across swollen abdomens. Others exhibit the characteristic pallor, their flesh taking on the gray-green hue that will eventually dominate their appearance. All watch me with fevered eyes, desperate for the gifts I bring. I remember my own initiation, though the details grow fuzzy with each passing century. The pain remains vivid, however. The feeling of my organs liquefying within me, my innards becoming a breeding ground for diseases so complex they developed rudimentary sentience. I recall screaming until my vocal cords dissolved, then continuing to scream through a throat filled with squirming parasites. The recruits before me will experience similar torments, some will not survive. Those who do will never be the same. Brothers, I say, my voice a gurgling whisper that echoes wetly in the chamber. Today you receive the blessings of the grandfather. Today you transcend the limitations of your former existence. Today you begin your journey into glorious rot. I approach the first initiate, a former imperial guardsman by the look of him. His face still bears the regimental tattoo of the Mordian Iron Guard, though the ink has begun to blur as the skin beneath it softens. He does not flinch as I raise my Narthesium. They never do. By the time they reach this chamber, they have already experienced pain beyond mortal comprehension. The reductor wears to life, its drill bit penetrating the initiate's neck with surgical precision. But I am not extracting, I am implanting. The vial attached to my gauntlet contains a slurry of viral agents, bacterial colonies, and fragments of my own corrupted gene seed. The mixture enters the aspirant's bloodstream, and I watch as his eyes widen, then cloud over as the infection takes root. one by one i move down the line each injection varies slightly from the last grandfather nurgel delights in variety in the endless permutations of decay no two death guards share identical afflictions it is one of our greatest strengths and the source of our individuality within the legion some develop caustic blood that eats through their own armor Others become living incubators for swarms of insects that burst from their wounds in battle. My own gift manifests as a perpetual state of decomposition and regeneration, my flesh constantly sloughing away and renewing itself in an endless cycle. As I administer the final blessing, the chamber fills with the sound of wretching. The initiates collapse one by one, their bodies convulsing as the transformation accelerates. Bile and blood pool on the deck plates, mingling with other, less identifiable fluids. The stench is magnificent, a complex bouquet of biological processes gone awry. I inhale deeply, savoring the aroma through olfactory sensors, long since adapted to appreciate such perfumes. The pain is your companion now, I tell them as they writhe. It will never leave you. In time, you will come to cherish it as I do. Pain is the proof of your existence. Pain is the voice of the grandfather whispering his love. I leave them to their suffering. There is nothing more I can do for them at this stage. either they will adapt their bodies embracing the corruption i have introduced or they will die in agony their remains recycled into the biomass that feeds the ship both outcomes serve the plague father equally well my duties as an apothecary extend beyond the induction of new recruits i must tend to the engines of the rotspire massive organic constructs that no longer resemble the plasma reactors they once were The engine room stretches before me, a cathedral of disease. Pulsating growths cover every surface, throbbing in unison like a massive heart. Tubes run from these fleshy protuberances to the walls, pumping infected fluids throughout the vessel. The machine spirits that once inhabited this place have long since gone mad, their binary consciousness infected by warp entities that reduced their logic to gibbering insanity. The chief engin' seer acknowledges me with a nod of his misshapen head, Once human, or perhaps once Astartes, his form has been so thoroughly transformed that his original nature is impossible to determine. Mecadendrites sprout from his back, but instead of the clean lines of imperial technology, these appendages resemble intestines, coiling and writhing with apparent autonomy. Brother Varkas. He gurgles through a mouth that opens vertically across what was once his chest, The third ventricle requires your attention. Its fever has grown worse. I nod, understanding the implications. The engines of the rot-spire are alive in ways that would horrify even the most radical tech priest of Mars. They suffer illnesses, develop infections, experience growth spurts, and metamorphoses. My role is to ensure these biological processes serve our purposes rather than running rampant. It is a delicate balance, allowing enough mutation to keep the systems viable while preventing the kind of uncontrolled growth that might rupture the hull. The third ventricle pulses an angry red, its temperature elevated well beyond optimal parameters. I place my hand against the throbbing mass, feeling the irregular rhythm of its contractions. Something has taken root within, a secondary infection that threatens the primary one. This is the paradox of our existence. Even entities of disease must guard against certain maladies. I prepare a concoction from the various vials strapped to my belt. Each contains a specific strain of bacteriophage, viruses that infect and destroy bacteria. In the days before my transformation, I used similar tools to combat infection in wounded battle brothers. Now I use them to treat infections within infections, a recursive practice that sometimes strikes me as darkly humorous. The needle of my narthesium penetrates the ventricle, and I depress the plunger. the effect is immediate the angry red tissue begins to mottle patches of green and black appearing as the phages go to work the engincia makes a sound that might be satisfaction as the ventricles pulsations grow more regular it will hold for another campaign I tell him, though neither of us measures time in such conventional terms anymore. Campaigns blur together in my memory, planets and systems merging into a continuous stream of destruction and contamination. We bring Nergal's gifts to the galaxy, spreading them with the religious fervor of true believers. Each world that falls to plague is a hymn sung to our patron. Each corrupted ecosystem is a prayer made manifest. As I work, I become aware of whispering. The voices emanate from the ventilation ducts, a chorus of childlike tones speaking in unison, Nurglings, the diminutive daemons that infest every corner of the ship, They watch me constantly, reporting my actions back to their master, the great unclean one that dwells in the lower decks. I have grown accustomed to their scrutiny, even find comfort in it. It is good to be observed, to have witnesses to my devotion. The grandfather is pleased with you, apothecary. They giggle, their voices echoing metallically through the ducts. You tend his garden with such care. I acknowledge them with a slight inclination of my head. Engaging directly with the Nurglings can lead to lengthy, circular conversations that distract from my duties. They are like children, curious and mischievous, but their attention spans are mercifully short. After a few more whispered observations, they grow bored and scurry deeper into the ship's infrastructure, off to torment some other crew member." The engine seer gestures toward a nearby growth, one I had not noticed before. A new development, he explains. It began forming after our last transition through the warp. I believe it may be attempting to communicate. I examine the growth with professional interest. Unlike the pulsating masses that comprise most of the engine room, this formation has a more structured appearance. Its surface is covered in what resemble vocal cords, vibrating slightly with each breath of hot, fetid air that circulates through the chamber. I lean closer, and the growth responds to my presence, the vibrations intensifying. What are you trying to say? I ask, more to myself than to the growth. To my surprise, it answers, not in words, but in images that flood my mind. I see a planet, blue and verdant. I see spores descending through its atmosphere, carried on solar winds. I see forests withering, lakes turning to slurry, animals collapsing as their organs liquefy within them. I see the population, humanoid, but not human. their bodies erupting with boils as they cry out to gods who do not answer. The vision fades, leaving me momentarily disoriented. The growth has shown me our next target, a world ripe for Nurgle's blessing. Such psychic communications are not uncommon aboard the Rotspire, The barrier between real space and the warp grows thin within these halls, allowing for transmissions that would be impossible elsewhere. I will report the vision to our Lord, though I suspect he has already received the message through his own communion with the Plague Father. My rounds continue, taking me through the labyrinthine corridors of the vessel, I pass fellow death guard, each bearing their unique constellation of diseases and mutations. We acknowledge one another with nods or gestures, words unnecessary between those who share our condition. Despite the individualized nature of our afflictions, we maintain a brotherhood stronger than that of any loyal Space Marine chapter. We are united not by doctrine or discipline, but by shared suffering. by the daily endurance of torments that would break the minds of lesser beings. I reach a junction where the corridor splits into three branches, the left passage leads to the quarters I maintain out of habit rather than necessity. Sleep rarely comes to me now, and when it does, my dreams are indistinguishable from the fevered hallucinations that plague my waking hours. The right passage leads to the bridge, where our Lord plots the course of our eternal crusade against the Imperium. The central passage descends into the bowels of the ship, where reality grows thin and the denizens of the warp manifest freely. I choose the central path. There is someone I must consult. The descent is long, marked by increasing dilapidation. The relatively maintained upper decks give way to regions where corruption has advanced beyond control. Here, the ship has been completely overtaken by organic growth. The walls pulse visibly, respiratory systems that process the stale air into noxious gases. The floor beneath my feet squelches, composed of a fungal mat several feet thick. Tendrils reach for my boots as I pass, recognizing me as a vector for new infectious agents they might incorporate. The temperature rises with each level I descend. By the time I reach my destination, the air has become so thick with moisture and spores that it resembles fog, limiting visibility to a few feet. The chamber I enter stretches beyond what should be physically possible within the confines of the ship, a spatial distortion that signals the proximity of a warp entity. Morbidux awaits me, his massive form dominating the center of the chamber. A great unclean one, greater daemon of Nurgle, embodiment of the plague father's generosity. His bloated body rises nearly twenty feet tall. His skin a patchwork of lesions, boils, and open sores that weep constantly. A single great horn protrudes from the left side of his head, the right horn having broken off during some ancient battle. His belly, distended and transparent, reveals the silhouettes of creatures that swim within his digestive juices. His smile, stretching literally from ear to ear, displays rows of rotting teeth in receding gums, Little brother, he greets me, his voice surprisingly melodious for a being of such grotesque appearance. You have come to share your progress. I kneel before him, not out of fear but genuine reverence. Morbidux has been my mentor since my transformation, guiding me through the intricacies of Nurgle's blessings with paternal patience. It was he who showed me how to use my apothecary skills in service to our new master, how to transform the sacred duties of my former position into rituals honoring the Lord of Decay. The new initiates have received their first inoculations. I report. Their transformations proceed as expected. The ship's systems remain stable, despite the anomaly in the third ventricle. Morbiduc's nods, sending ripples through the folds of fat that obscure his neck. And what of your own journey, apothecary? Does your spirit embrace the gifts you have been given? The question catches me off guard, though it should not. Morbidux asks this of me every time we meet, and my answer is never quite satisfactory, to either of us. Even after millennia of service to Nurgle, part of me remains stubbornly attached to my former identity, not out of loyalty to the false emperor, whose name I can no longer speak without vomiting black bile, but out of a sense that I have lost something essential in my transformation. I serve with devotion, I reply carefully. my skills advance the grandfather's will across the galaxy morbidoc sighs a sound like wind blowing through a charnel house still you cling to the remnants of your former self still you perform your duties as though they were obligations rather than joyous expressions of faith He leans forward, bringing his postulent face close to mine. The others have embraced their nature, Varkas. They revel in the blessings bestowed upon them. Why do you resist the final surrender? I have no answer that would satisfy him. How can I explain that my reluctance is not rejection but a form of preservation? that I maintain this distance, this final barrier between my consciousness and complete corruption, because I fear what I might become without it. Perhaps. Morbidux continues when I remain silent. You require a more direct communion with the grandfather. Perhaps you have grown too comfortable in your role, too secure in your routines. A ripple of alarm passes through me. Direct communion with Nurgle is not something any mortal, even an Astartes, undertakes lightly. Those who experience such connection often lose themselves entirely, their identities subsumed by the overwhelming presence of the Chaos God. I have served faithfully for ten thousand years, I say, unable to keep a note of desperation from my voice. My devotion is absolute. Devotion without joy is mere obligation, morbidux counters. The grandfather desires children who embrace his gifts wholeheartedly, who understand that what appears as decay to the ignorant is actually the blossoming of new life. Before I can respond, a tremor runs through the ship, The organic walls of the chamber contract violently, and a keening whale emerges from everywhere at once. The rot-spire has translated back into real space, the trauma of the transition affecting its living systems. Morbidux straightens his attention diverted by the disturbance. We have arrived, he announces. The world I showed you awaits our blessings. Go, prepare your brothers for planet fall. We will continue this discussion upon your return. Relieved by the reprieve, I bow and back away from the demon. As I turn to leave, Morbidux calls after me. Consider what I have said, apothecary. The grandfather's patience is vast but not infinite. Eventually, all his children must fully embrace his love or face his disappointment. The threat in those words follows me as I ascend back through the ship. Nurgle's disappointment manifests as fates worse than death, afflictions that make even the torments of the Death Guard seem, merciful by comparison. I have seen battle brothers who failed in their duties transformed into spawn, their bodies losing all cohesion, becoming masses of constantly mutating flesh, with just enough consciousness remaining to understand their condition. By the time I reach the upper decks, the ship has stabilized. The transition complete, we now orbit the target world. Through viewports encrusted with organic matter, I catch glimpses of a blue-green sphere. From this distance, it appears pristine, unspoiled. Soon it will join the countless worlds we have visited before. Its biosystems corrupted, its population transformed into vessels for Nurgle's endless experimentation. The assault bay teems with activity as Death Guard prepare for planet fall. Plague Marines check their weapons, their movements deliberate and unhurried. There is no urgency in our Legion, no frantic energy like that displayed by the berserkers of Korn or the sensation seekers of Slanesh. We advance with the inexorable patience of decay itself, secure in the knowledge that all things must eventually succumb. My role in the coming battle will be twofold. As an apothecary, I will harvest genetic material from worthy adversaries, particularly if we encounter loyalist space marines. As a vector of contagion, I will ensure the deployment of the biological weapons we have cultivated for this specific world. Each planet requires a customized approach, a plague tailored to its particular ecosystem. The artistry involved in such customization is one of the few aspects of my duty that still brings me satisfaction. Lord Pustulus, commander of the Rotspire, addresses the assembled Death Guard. His form has grown so massive over the millennia that he requires a palanquin to move, carried by a swarm of nurglings that skitter beneath the platform like insects. His armor, once the proud green of the Death Guard, has corroded to a motled brown, broken by patches where his swollen flesh protrudes through gaps in the Ceramite." a forest of antlers crowns his head marking him as one of nurgles favoured brothers he weases his voice bubbling through a respirator that no longer serves its original purpose now acting as a dispersal system for airborne pathogens The world below has never known the touch of chaos. Its inhabitants worship false gods of order and stagnation. We bring them liberation from their sterile existence. We bring them the truth they have been denied, that life and death are not opposites, but phases in an eternal cycle of renewal. A chorus of approval rises from the assembled marines, a cacophony of wet coughing, rattling breath, and flemy laughter. I join in automatically, though my thoughts remain troubled by my conversation with Morbidux. After all this time, am I still not fully committed to our cause? Does some part of me still cling to the imperial dogma I was raised with? The drop pods wait, their interiors slick with mucus and other secretions. Unlike the clean, utilitarian pods used by loyalist Marines, ours have been thoroughly corrupted, their machine spirits replaced by minor daemons that guide their descent with malevolent intelligence. I enter one such pod alongside four other Marines, each of us securing ourselves as best we can with restraints that resemble intestinal cords more than mechanical harnesses. The journey to the surface passes in a blur of sensation, the violent shaking as we enter the atmosphere, the screaming of the daemon bound to our transport, the smell of my brothers, their diseases flaring in response to the stress of planetfall, the taste of anticipation, metallic and sweet on my tongue, and then impact, a bone-jarring crash that would kill an unaugmented human but merely jostles us within our corrupted armor. The pod splits open like a rotten fruit, disgorging us onto the surface of the world. We emerge into a landscape of geometrically perfect architecture, white structures rising in mathematical harmony, against a sky of deepest blue. The contrast between this sterile environment and our corrupted forms could not be more stark. We are a stain spreading across an immaculate canvas, a cancer introduced into healthy tissue, The inhabitants flee at our approach, their slender forms moving with a grace that seems obscene in its perfection. They are humanoid, but clearly Xenos. Their skin are pale lavender, their limbs longer and more delicate than human norm. Their screams have a musical quality, like wind instruments played by unskilled hands. I ready my bolt pistol, but do not fire. My purpose here is not primarily combat. I remove a canister from my belt. one of several I have prepared for this mission. Inside, writhes a culture of bacteria engineered specifically for this world's biosphere, designed to spread rapidly through air and water, infecting all life forms it encounters. The effects will vary depending on the physiology of the infected, but all will experience Nurgle's embrace in some form. With a twist, I activate the canister's dispersal mechanism. A cloud of spores erupts into the air, caught by the breeze and carried toward the fleeing Xenos. I watch with professional satisfaction as the first spores make contact. The effect is immediate and dramatic. The Xenos closest to the clouds stumble, their graceful movements becoming erratic. One falls to its knees, hands clutching at its throat as the skin there begins to bubble and distend. Around me, my brothers engage the enemy's defenders, warriors clad in armor that resembles insect carapaces. Their weapons fire beams of coherent light that slice through the air with surgical precision. Where these beams strike death guard, they burn through corrupted armor and necrotic flesh, but cause little true damage. Our bodies, sustained by the power of Nurgle, can absorb punishment that would destroy other Astartes. I move through the battle methodically, deploying my canisters at strategic points, ensuring maximum dispersal of our biological weapons. As I work, I monitor the progression of the plague, noting how it affects different organisms. The flora responds most rapidly, vibrant plants wilting and delicasing within minutes of exposure. The alien defenders take longer to succumb, their armor providing some initial protection, but eventually, even they begin to show signs of infection. Skin darkens around the eye slits of their helmets. Movements become sluggish. Weapons are dropped as hands transform into useless, swollen appendages. Hours pass as we push deeper into the alien city. Resistance grows sporadic, then ceases entirely. The survivors no longer flee, but lie where they have fallen, their bodies undergoing the first stages of transformation. Some will die from this initial exposure, Others will survive, becoming hosts for the next generation of the plague, their bodies acting as incubators for increasingly virulent strains. As night falls on the conquered city, we establish a forward base in what appears to have been a temple. The architecture here is even more precisely geometric than elsewhere. every angle and curve calculated to mathematical perfection. Statues of the Xenos's gods line the walls, depicting entities of pure energy, their forms composed of interlocking geometric patterns. I find their sterile beauty offensive, an affront to the glorious chaos of organic processes. Lord Pustulus orders the statues destroyed, not out of mere vandalism, but as part of the psychological warfare we wage alongside the biological. The Zenos must understand that their gods of order cannot protect them from the fundamental truth of existence. Entropy always increases, and decay claims all in the end. As my brothers smash the statues, I continue my work, cataloguing the progression of the plague through the local ecosystem. The speed of transmission exceeds my projections, a pleasing result that I will document for future reference. Already, the city shows signs of Nurgle's touch. Fungi sprout from cracks in the once immaculate pavements. Pools of stagnant liquid form where none existed before. The air grows thick with spores, visible as a greenish haze in the gathering darkness. A noise draws my attention to a partially collapsed building. Moving cautiously, bolt pistol ready, I investigate. Inside, I find a group of Xenos huddled together, adults surrounding their young in a futile gesture of protection. All show advanced signs of infection. Their once smooth skin erupting with boils, their limbs swollen to grotesque proportions. They regard me with eyes clouded by cataracts of fungal growth, but make no move to flee or attack. they have accepted their fate. One of the adults addresses me in a voice rendered guttural by the transformation of its vocal apparatus. The language is unknown to me, but the universal translator built into my armor provides an approximate rendering. Why do you do this? What God demands such cruelty? I could ignore the question, I could execute them all, and continue with my duties. But something in the Xenos's gaze compels me to respond, to articulate the philosophy that underpins our actions. Your understanding of cruelty is limited. I tell it, my voice emerging as a wet rasp through my corrupted Vox grill. you see only the surface phenomenon, the apparent suffering. You do not comprehend the deeper truth that what we bring is not death, but transformation. Not an ending, but a new beginning. The translator renders my words into the Zeno's language, and I watch comprehension dawn in its diseased eyes, followed by horror deeper than the mere physical fear it displayed before. You believe this, it says, the statement carrying a weight of realization. You truly believe you are helping us. Belief implies doubt. I correct it. I know the truth of Nurgle's blessing because I have experienced it firsthand. I know the liberation that comes with surrender to decay. Your species clings to the illusion of permanence, of stasis. You build your cities to last for eons. You extend your lives through technology. You fight against the natural order with every resource at your disposal. And yet, in the end, entropy claims all. we merely accelerate the inevitable the zeno's shudders whether from the progression of disease or the horror of my words i cannot tell our children it gestures to the smaller forms huddled behind it they have barely begun to live For a moment something stirs within me, a memory of another life, of principles once held sacred. The apothecary I had been would never have condoned the deliberate infection of non-combatants, let alone juveniles. That version of myself had taken oaths to heal, to preserve life, to alleviate suffering. What would he think of what I have become? I pushed the thought away, recognizing it as a dangerous indulgence." Such reflections lead to doubt, and doubt leads to failure. I have seen too many brothers fall because they could not fully commit to the path we walk. Life takes many forms, I tell the Zenos. What you call death is merely transition. Your children will serve the grandfather in their new forms. They will know pleasures and pains beyond your comprehension. With that, I turn and leave them to their transformation. There is nothing more to be said, no comfort I can or should offer. Nergal's path is not an easy one, but it is the only path that acknowledges the fundamental truth of existence. Nothing lasts, nothing remains unchanged, all things must decay. As I emerge from the building, I see that night has fully fallen. The moons of this world, three perfect spheres of varying sizes, cast an eerie light over the dying city. In that light I can see the progression of our work. The geometric perfection of the architecture is already breaking down, organic growths disrupting the clean lines, introducing chaos into order. My brothers have established a perimeter around the temple, though such, precautions are largely unnecessary at this point. The few Zenos who might pose a threat are either dead or incapacitated by disease. Still, old habits persist even after ten millennia. The death-guard were once the most disciplined of the Emperor's legions, and echoes of that discipline remain in our procedures, if not our appearance. I make my report to Lord Pustulus, who receives it with a series of wet, bubbling noises that might be laughter. Excellent work, apothecary. He weases. The grandfather will be pleased with your diligence. a nurgling perches on his paldron its diminutive form a miniature parody of pustulus himself it cackles and points at me with a stubby finger the doubter succeeds despite himself it squeaks in a voice like tearing parchment his heart resists while his hands serve pustulus regards me with rhymy eyes suddenly intent Is this true, Brother Varkas? Does your heart resist our grandfather's blessings? The question echoes Morbidux's earlier interrogation, suggesting a coordinated concern among my superiors. I choose my words carefully, aware that denial would be transparent, but unwilling to confess the full extent of my ambivalence. I serve faithfully. I repeat the same formulation I gave Morbidux. My actions advance the grandfather's design. Your actions, yes, Pustulus agrees, reaching up to stroke the Nurgling, which preens under his touch. But Nurgle desires more than mere obedience. He desires love, devotion, ecstatic surrender to his gifts. The massive death guard shifts on his palanquin, causing the Nurglings beneath to squeal as they readjust their formation. Perhaps you require a more immersive experience of the grandfather's bounty." Before I can respond, a series of explosions rocks the night. The perimeter has been breached. Turning toward the disturbance, I see sleek aircraft swooping low over the city, their hulls reflecting the moonlight with metallic brilliance. More Zenos, but not the same, species as the inhabitants of this world. These craft bear the angular design aesthetic of the Aeuldari, specifically the craft world variety rather than their darker kin. Interesting. Pustulus muses, seemingly unconcerned by the attack. The Eldari rarely intervene in the affairs of other species, unless their own interests are directly threatened. I understand his lack of concern. The Eldari are formidable opponents, their technology far advanced beyond most races in the galaxy. But they are also fragile, their population dwindling, each loss keenly felt. They cannot afford a prolonged engagement with the Death Guard, whose resilience makes us particularly difficult for them to eliminate. The craft disgorge warriors in streamlined armor, their movements are blur of inhuman speed and grace. They wield shuriken catapults, weapons that fire molecularly edged discs capable of slicing through even power armor. Several of my brothers fall as the deadly projectiles find joints and weak points in their corroded plate. I ready my bolt pistol and take cover behind a fallen pillar, assessing the situation with tactical detachment. The Eldari attack is precise and coordinated, targeting specific death guard rather than engaging in general combat. They are after something or someone. A flash of psychic energy announces the arrival of a more potent threat. An Eldari Farsia materializes at the center of the temple courtyard, her ornate helm, and elaborately crafted witchblade marking her rank. She points directly at me, and speaks a command in the musical language of her kind. Immediately, three Eldari warriors break from the main group and sprint in my direction, covering the distance with supernatural speed." I fire my bolt pistol, the mass reactive rounds detonating against psychic shields that flare blue with each impact. One warrior falls as a lucky shot penetrates the shield, the bolt exploding within his slender torso and shredding his internal organs. The other two, reach me before I can cycle another round. I draw my plague knife, a corroded blade slick with toxins that can kill with the slightest scratch. the first aildare dodges my swing with insulting ease while the second drives his own blade into a joint in my armor penetrating the festering flesh beneath pain flares bright and immediate but i ignore it Pain has been my constant companion for millennia. It is merely another sensation to be noted and dismissed. I grab the arm of the warrior who stabbed me, my ceramite gauntlet crushing the delicate bones of his wrist. He screams, the sound like breaking crystal, and drops his blade. With my other hand, I drive my plague knife into his throat, just below the jawline of his helm. The blade penetrates, and I feel the satisfying resistance of flesh parting beneath the edge. The dying Eildari convulses as the toxins enter his bloodstream, his limbs thrashing in a seizure so violent that it wrenches him from my grasp. He collapses, foam bubbling from beneath his helm, his body already beginning to dissolve from within as the aggressive pathogens go to work. The second warrior attacks again, wielding a power sword that hums with contained energy. I parry with my plague knife, the corrupted metal somehow holding against the power field that should slice through it. Nurgle's blessings manifest in many forms, and the resilience of our weapons against technologies that should overcome them is one such miracle. As we duel, more death guard converge on our position, drawn by the commotion. The Aildari warrior, recognizing the change in tactical situation, disengages with a series of backward flips that carry him beyond my reach. He rejoins his companions, who have formed a defensive circle around the Farsir. The psychic witch raises her arms, and a dome of energy springs into existence around her group. Through this translucent barrier, I see her making complicated gestures with her hands, weaving a more complex working. A. Webway portal, I realize. They are creating an escape route. Lord Pustulus bellows orders, directing all available firepower against the psychic dome. Bolt rounds, plague spewers, and blight launchers concentrate their fire, but the barrier holds against this onslaught. Within seconds, the shimmering outline of a portal takes form behind the Aildari group. One by one, they back through it. maintaining their defensive formation until only the Farsia remains. She turns to face me directly, and though her features are hidden behind her helm, I feel the weight of her gaze. Her voice sounds in my mind, bypassing the physical entirely. Your path is not yet fixed. Corrupted one. Even now, choice remains. Then she is gone, stepping backward through the portal, which collapses in on itself with a sound like tearing silk. The sudden silence feels oppressive after the chaos of battle. My brothers look to one another in confusion, trying to make sense of the brief, targeted attack. What did the Aeldari want? Why risk their precious lives against the death guard only to withdraw after causing minimal damage? Lord Pustulus summons me to his side, his expression unreadable beneath the layers of corruption that have transformed his once human face. The witch spoke to you, he states. Not a question but an accusation. What did she say? I consider lying, but know it would be futile. Psychic communication leaves traces that one is experienced as Pustulus would detect. She said my path is not fixed. That I still have choice. Pustulus is silent for a long moment, the only sound the constant bubbling of the fluids that fill his bloated form. Interesting, he says finally. The Eldari are known for their foresight. Their Farsiers glimpse possible futures and sometimes act to nudge events toward outcomes they prefer. He leans forward, his massive bulk shifting precariously on the Palanquin, what future do you think she saw brother varkas what choice might you make that concerns the eldari enough to mount such an operation i have no answer to give him no explanation that would not incriminate me further the farcea's words echo in my mind alongside morbidux's warning and the nergling's accusation three separate sources, all pointing to the same conclusion. My commitment to Nurgle's path is being questioned, not just by my superiors, but by the very enemies of chaos. I am Deathguard, I say, finally. I have been for ten millennia. Whatever future the witch foresees, she will find it does not include my betrayal. Pustulus nods slowly, but I can see he is not convinced. We shall see, brother apothecary. We shall see. The incident with the Eldari fades into memory as our campaign progresses across the doomed world. City after city falls to our advance, each one transformed from geometric perfection into organic chaos. The Zeno's population dwindles, not through death alone but through transformation. The survivors of the initial infection become carriers, their bodies hosting new strains of the plague that they spread to their uninfected brethren. I continue my duties, documenting the progression of the disease, harvesting samples for future use, ensuring the maximum efficacy of our biological weapons. Yet I cannot shake the sense that I am being watched more closely than before. Nurglings shadow my movements, barely bothering to conceal themselves as they scuttle after me through the ruins. My fellow Death Guard regard me with subtle changes in demeanor, a certain weariness that suggests they have been warned about me. The campaign reaches its conclusion when the final city falls. The Zenos offer no further resistance, those still capable of conscious thought having accepted the inevitability of their transformation. What began as a military operation transitions into a religious ritual as we establish shrines to Nurgle across the corrupted landscape, consecrating the world to his service. We return to the rot-spire, its bulk hanging in orbit above the conquered planet like a bloated tick, gorged on the blood of its host. The assault craft dock in bays slick with the discharge of the living vessel, the walls pulsing in what might be anticipation or mere autonomic response to stimuli. I make my way toward my quarters, intent on cataloguing the samples I have collected before reporting to Lord Pustulus. The corridors seem emptier than usual, the normal traffic of death guard and attendant nerglings conspicuously absent. The silence puts me on alert, my hands straying to the bolt pistol at my side. The door to my quarters stands ajar, though I am certain I sealed it before planet fall. I approach cautiously, aware that I may be walking into an ambush. Pushing the door fully open with the barrel of my pistol, I scan the chamber beyond. Morbidux waits inside, his massive bulk somehow accommodated by the space despite the physical impossibility of such an arrangement. The room has changed to accept him, the walls bulging outward, the ceiling rising to cathedral height. Reality bends in the presence of greater daemons, conforming to their needs rather than constraining them. Welcome back, little brother. The demon greets me, his tone genial, but his eyes sharp with assessment. I hear your mission was a success. Another world brought into the grandfather's embrace. I nod, holstering my pistol since it would provide no defense against such an entity. The Xenos proved susceptible to the strains we developed. Transformation proceeded more rapidly than anticipated." Morbiduck's smiles, the expression splitting his face almost literally as the skin at the corners of his mouth tears slightly, releasing a trickle of yellowish fluid. And yet, something troubles you. I can taste the discord in your soul, Varkas. It sours the air around you. There seems little point in denial. Morbidux, as a direct servant of Nurgle, possesses senses that extend beyond the physical. He can likely perceive the stay, turmoil within me as clearly as I might observe a fever in a patient. The Aildare Farsir, I admit, Her words have stayed with me. She spoke of choices still available, paths not yet fixed. Mobyduk's nods, unsurprised. The Aildari see many possible futures, but understand few of them. They meddle in affairs beyond their comprehension, seeking to manipulate strands of fate toward outcomes they prefer. He leans forward, bringing his postulent face close to mine. But they are not the only ones who can glimpse what may be. The demon extends one bloated hand, palm upward, offering it to me. The grandfather has sent me to bring you into his garden, Varkas. He wishes to show you the truth that you have resisted for so long. He wishes to answer the questions that plague your heart. I stare at the offered hand, understanding what it represents. Direct communion with Nurgle, the experience I have avoided despite 10,000 years of service. The final surrender of self that I have resisted through countless battles and transformations. and if i refuse the words escape before i can consider their implications damning me with their very utterance no loyal servant of nurgle would hesitate at such an opportunity morbidoc's sighs a sound like wind through rotting vegetation then you confirm what we have suspected that your heart remains divided your service incomplete the massive hand remains extended But refusal would be foolish, little brother. The grandfather does not invite many to his garden. Such an honor is rarely bestowed and never twice offered. I think of my existence these past millennia. The endless cycle of battle, corruption, and decay. The slow erosion of my former self, memories fading like parchment left in the sun. What am I preserving by my resistance? What remnant of the apothecary I once was still exists to be saved? And yet, surrender feels like failure. The final admission that nothing of value remains from my former existence, that the oaths I took, the principles I held sacred, the very identity that defined me, have all been corroded beyond recovery. Time grows short, Morbidux warns. Already the Eldari move to interfere further. Already wheels turn that may remove this choice from your hands. With a sense of inevitability, I reach out and place my gauntleted hand in his. The contact is immediate and overwhelming, reality dissolves around me, the confines of my quarters replaced by an endless garden of impossible flora. Plants that should not exist outside of nightmare flourish here, their blooms formed of tumorous growths, their stems pulsing with infected fluids, The air hangs heavy with the scent of decay, not the sharp stench of recent death but the complex, almost sweet aroma of advanced decomposition, of matter breaking down into its constituent elements to feed new growth. I stand in the garden of Nurgle, the realm of the plague god within the warp. My physical form has accompanied me, or a manifestation of it has, my corrupted armor and desiccated flesh appearing much as they do in real space. But here, I can see the diseases that infest me as luminous entities, symbiotes rather than parasites, each one a living testament to Nurgle's creativity. Beautiful, is it not? The voice comes from everywhere and nowhere, impossibly deep yet childlike in its enthusiasm. Nurgle himself, though I see no physical manifestation of the Chaos God, Perhaps he is the garden, his consciousness distributed throughout the endless expanse of diseased vegetation and toxic pools. My finest creations, given room to grow and flourish, free from the constraints of physical law. I try to respond but find my voice inadequate to the task. How does one address a God? What words could possibly bridge the gap between my limited consciousness and the vast, incomprehensible mind of a warp entity? You need not speak aloud, the voice assures me. I hear the thoughts you cannot articulate, the doubts you, barely acknowledge to yourself. There is no anger in the tone, only a paternal patience that I find more terrifying than rage would be. You have served me well, Varkas, despite your reservations. Your creations spread my blessings across the galaxy with artful precision, yet you deny yourself the joy that should accompany such work. The scene shifts around me, the garden receding as new images form. I see myself as I once was, an apothecary of the death guard when they still served the Emperor. My armor gleams with the pride of maintenance, the green and white livery unmarred by corruption. I move through the aftermath of battle, tending to wounded brothers, extracting gene seed from the fallen with reverent care. You cling to this image of yourself, Nurgle's voice observes. This dutiful healer, this preserver of life and legacy. You believe that in resisting complete surrender to my gifts, you maintain some connection to this former self. The scene changes again. Now I see myself as I am, or as I appear in real space. My corrupted form moves through the halls of the Rotspire, performing duties that parody those of my former position. I harvest gene seed that writhes with infection. I tend to engines that pulse with unnatural life. I administer treatments that spread disease rather than curing it. You see contradiction, where there is continuity, Nurgle tells me. You perceive your current existence as a perversion of your former purpose, rather than its logical evolution. Again the scene shifts, but now I see something unexpected. My current form tends to a death guard warrior whose mutations have progressed beyond sustainable levels, threatening to transform him into mindless spawn. With surgical precision, I excise the unstable tissue, applying compounds that stabilize the remaining mutations. The warrior will survive, his consciousness intact, his service to the Legion able to continue. You still heal, Nurgle's voice points out. You still preserve, life, after a fashion. You still exercise the skills that defined you, though toward different ends. more scenes appear and dissolve, myself synthesizing cures for diseases that would destroy rather than transform. calibrating the balance of infections to ensure maximum suffering without death, preserving the consciousness of warriors whose physical forms have been almost entirely replaced by cancerous growths. This is the truth you have refused to acknowledge," Nurgle says, his voice taking on a didactic tone, like a teacher explaining a simple concept to a stubborn child. Death is not my dominion, Varkas. Death is the province of the Anathema. the corpse you once called emperor he offers only ending only cessation i offer continuation endless mutable life the eternal cycle of decay and rebirth the scenes fade and i find myself once more in the garden but now i am not alone A figure approaches through the foliage, massive and bloated yet moving with incongruous grace. Nurgle manifests before me, his form both repulsive and strangely comforting in its completeness. Every disease imaginable infests his body, yet he exists in a state of perfect equilibrium, neither overcome by their effects nor free from their influence. You stand at a crossroads, he tells me. his actual voice even more overwhelming than the disembodied one that spoke earlier the aildari seek to turn you from my path believing they see a future where you might serve their inscrutable purposes they are short-sighted seeing only threads of possibility without understanding the tapestry they form He extends a hand toward me, mirroring Morbidux's earlier gesture. I offer you clarity, apothecary. I offer you purpose unbound by the lies you were taught in your youth. I offer you the freedom to embrace what you have become without reservation or regret. I look into the face of the God I have served for ten millennia, and for the first time, I truly see him. Not as a monstrous entity, of pure corruption, but as a necessary counterbalance to the sterile order represented by the emperor. Without decay, there can be no renewal. Without death, life becomes meaningless repetition. Without disease, organisms never develop resilience. In that moment of clarity, I make my choice. not through words or conscious thought, but through the complete surrender of my resistance. I open myself fully to Nurgle's influence, allowing the last barriers within my mind to dissolve like flesh in acid. The effect is immediate and transformative. Joy floods through me, an emotion I had nearly forgotten in my millennia of dutiful service. I see the beauty in the garden around me, the perfect logic of each disease, the artistry in every pattern of decay. I understand that my work as an apothecary has never ceased, only evolved to serve a deeper truth than the one I was taught. Nurgle's laughter surrounds me, warm and genuinely pleased. At last, he says, you understand, at last you are truly mine. reality shifts once more and i find myself back in my quarters aboard the rotspire more bedox is gone but his presence lingers in the altered dimensions of the room which has not yet returned to its original proportions I am alone, yet more connected than I have ever been. The diseases within me sing with renewed vigor, a chorus of life processes celebrating their existence. I move to a reflective surface, curious to see if my appearance has changed with this internal transformation. The face that looks back at me is the same corrupted visage I have worn for thousands of years, yet somehow it seems different. The expression, perhaps. Where before there was grim determination, a stoic endurance of eternal suffering, now there is something like serenity. The acceptance of my nature has brought peace where resistance created only tension. A sound draws my attention to the door. A nurgling peers in, its diminutive form quivering with what might be excitement. The grandfather is pleased, it squeaks. The doubter doubts no more. the healer embraces the gift of disease. All rejoice. It scampers away before I can respond, off to spread the news of my transformation. I feel no embarrassment at having been the subject of such concern. Rather, I feel a sense of belonging stronger than any I have known since my induction into the death guard in that previous life. With newfound purpose, I gather my apothecary tools and exit my quarters, The corridors no longer seem empty. I sense the presence of Nurgle's lesser entities all around me, invisible to physical eyes but clear to my enhanced perception. They dance and cavort in celebration, welcoming me as a fully realized brother in their eternal revelry. I make my way to the septic chamber, where a new batch of initiates awaits my ministrations. As I enter, they regard me with the same fearful reverence I have seen countless times before, But now, instead of clinical detachment, I feel genuine warmth toward these aspirants. They stand at the beginning of a journey I have finally completed, and I will guide them with the wisdom of true experience. Brothers, I address them, my voice stronger and clearer than before, the gurgling quality now a harmonious undertone, rather than an impediment. Today you receive the blessings of our grandfather. Today you begin a transformation that has no end. Today, you join a family that extends beyond the boundaries of time and space. I raise my narthesium, its corrupted instruments gleaming in the sickly light of the chamber. The path ahead holds pain beyond imagination, but also joy beyond comprehension. The secrets of life and death will open themselves to you, revealing truths hidden from those who cling to the false security of order and stagnation. The first initiate steps forward, his eyes fever bright with anticipation. I see in him a reflection of myself as I once was, full of uncertainty masked by determination. But where I resisted the full embrace, of Nurgle's gifts for millennia, he opens himself willingly to what is to come, As the reductor pierces his flesh, delivering the customized cocktail of diseases that will begin his transformation, I feel a sense of rightness that has eluded me since the earliest days of my corruption. This is not a perversion of my duties as an apothecary. This is their perfect fulfillment. I am not destroying life, but elevating it to a state beyond the limitations of conventional biology. The initiate gasps as the infection takes hold, his eyes widening with the first shock of transformation. But instead of the horror I have seen so many times before, his expression shifts to one of wonder. I can feel it, he whispers. I can feel the life within the decay. Yes. i tell him placing a paternal hand on his shoulder that is the first truth there are many more awaiting you one by one the others step forward to receive their initiations with each procedure i take greater care than ever before ensuring that the particular blend of pathogens matches the individual constitution of the recipient this is not merely science or duty now it is artistry a creative act in service to a god of boundless invention As the last initiate receives his blessing, a ripple of sensation passes through the ship. The Rotspire shudders, its organic systems responding to some external stimulus. We have arrived at our next destination, another world waiting to receive Nurgle's generous attention. I secure my equipment and make my way to the bridge, eager to learn what new canvas awaits my artistic contributions." The future stretches before me, not as an endless repetition of duty, but as an opportunity for continuous growth and discovery. In surrendering the last vestige of my former self, I have not lost my identity but found it in its truest form. I am Varkas, apothecary of the Death Guard, faithful servant of Nurgle, artist of decay and rebirth. And I have never been more alive.

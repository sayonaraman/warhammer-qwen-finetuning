What is it really like when space marines face orcs on the battlefield? I record this testimony in my final moments, so our chapter might learn from my failures. The ash never stops on Carthos Prime. It falls like the softest snow, deceptive in its gentleness, accumulating on our poldrons and in the joints of our armor. Myogmetics calculate a 73% reduction in servo motor efficiency after only six hours of exposure. the iron fathers would be displeased the machine requires maintenance and i have failed to provide it ten days ten days since the drop pods screamed through the atmosphere ten days since the iron hands fifth company deployed to this emperor-forsaken world Our mission parameters were clear. Secure the Prometheum refineries in the southern hemisphere, eliminate the green-skin infestation, establish a forward operating base for the wider campaign. Simple, logical. A task worthy of the sons of Ferris Manus. I can still hear Brother Captain Dresick's voice through the Vox. The flesh is weak, brothers. But iron endures. Standard doctrine. Words I have lived by since my induction into the chapter, I believe them then, I am less certain now. My squad was assigned to Assault Group Delta. We deployed on the eastern flank, tasked with securing the high ground of the ash dunes. Twelve battle brothers under my command, veterans all. Each had replaced significant portions of their weak flesh with the purity of machine. I myself bear six major augmetics, including my right arm from the shoulder down and both legs below the knee. My left eye was replaced after the tyrannid campaign on Stratton IV. My lungs are reinforced with adamantium filters. My heart's monitor is directly linked to my armor's machine spirit. The perfection of the machine married to transhuman flesh. We were ready. The first wave of green skins came before dawn. My enhanced hearing picked up their approach three minutes and 27 seconds before they crested the ridge. A howling mass, half of green muscle and crude weapons, their silhouettes black against the gray-pink sky. I remember counting them, 137 orcs in the initial assault. My bolter accounted for nine. Brother Tharnes claimed twelve. Brother Kavos, our heavy weapons specialist, cut down twenty-three with the heavy bolter before they reached our position. Standard combat efficiency. We held the ridge. When the smoke cleared and the echoes of bolt fire faded, 89 orc corpses littered the slope before us. Three battlebrothers suffered minor damage to their armor. Brother Erzin had taken a glancing blow from a crude axe, the blade lodging in his poldron but failing to penetrate to the ceramite beneath. Minimal casualties, acceptable combat outcome, that was ten days ago. Now I sit alone on this same ridge, surrounded by thousands of green-skin corpses, the bodies of my brothers scattered among them. My armor is compromised in 17 places. My augmatic arm responds with a delay of 1.35 seconds, making precision targeting impossible. My ammunition reserves are at 12%. Both combat knives are missing, lost in the flesh of orcs whose names I will never know. The Vox has been silent for 26 hours, 14 minutes. I am going to die here. The thought is... unexpected. Space Marines are trained to accept death in service to the Emperor. We are his angels of death, his transhuman warriors. We know our purpose. We fulfill it without question. And yet, the augmentics in my skull record an elevated heart rate. My organic eye blinks rapidly while my augmentic one remains fixed, scanning the horizon. Physiological responses consistent with what mortals would call fear, unacceptable, I run the litany of fortitude through my mind, attempting to regulate my systems. It does not help. Movement on the Western approach. My augmatic eye zooms automatically, identifying a mass of green skins gathering for another assault. I count them by habit. They are learning. Each wave has been larger than the last. Each attack more coordinated. The crude beasts are adapting their tactics. I check my bolter. Twenty-seven rounds remaining. Not enough. The chainsword has fuel for perhaps thirty minutes of continuous operation. Also insufficient. I consider my options with mechanical precision. There are none that end with my survival. Logic dictates I should activate the self-destruct mechanism in my armor, deny the enemy the gene seed they might recover from my corpse. It would be the efficient choice, the machine choice. But something in my remaining flesh rebels against this conclusion. I am Brother Sergeant Varen of the Iron Hands. I have served the Emperor for 143 standard years. I have fought on 87 worlds. I have claimed 7,413 confirmed kills. I am the Emperor's wrath made manifest, and I am not ready to die. The orcs are moving now, a green tide flowing across the ash plains. They emit their crude war cries, a cacophony of bestial sounds that my helmet's audio dampeners struggle to filter. Their weapons are raised. A forest of jagged metal catching the light of Carthus Prime's dying sun. They are 300 meters from my position and closing rapidly. I stand, ignoring the damage reports flashing across my helm's display. I raise my boulder, centering it on the largest orc, a monster nearly twice the size of its fellows. Their leader, no doubt. Their war boss, in their primitive tongue. iron within i whisper the words emerging as a mechanical rasp through my helmet's vocalizer there is no one to answer with the traditional iron without i am alone the orcs are two hundred meters away now i can see the crude glyphs painted on their armor the mismatched plates salvaged from my fallen brothers One wears a space marine helmet as a grotesque trophy, the once proud Aquila now defaced with orc markings. I should feel rage at this, desecration. The logical response would be calculated fury, channeled into combat efficiency. Instead, I feel, nothing. A coldness spreads from my augmentics into my remaining flesh. Is this what the Iron Fathers promised? Is this the strength of the machine? One hundred meters. I can smell them now. Their bestial stink cutting through even my helmet's filtration systems. The ground trembles with their charge. Their voices merge into a single primal roar that seems to shake the very air. I think of my brothers. Not just those who fell here on this ridge, but all the iron hands. Are they wrong to seek the cold perfection of the machine? Or am I flawed for questioning our path in these, my final moments? Fifty meters. I can see individual faces now. Tusked mouths opened in endless screams of joy, red eyes burning with the simple pleasure of violence. They live for this moment, these crude zenos. They exist for battle in a way that even we space marines do not. We fight for duty, for the emperor, for humanity. They fight because fighting is what they are. 25 meters. I activate my chainsword, its angry growl a counterpoint to the Orc war cries. The vibration travels up my organic arm, and I realize with sudden clarity that I can feel it, feel the weight of the weapon, the texture of the grip, the subtle variations in its engine's pitch. Sensations my Augmatic arm would never register. Ten meters, I select single shot on my bolter. Twenty-seven rounds. 27 orcs that will fall before they reach me. I aim. I fire. The battle is joined. The first boulder round takes the lead orc in the throat, detonating inside its thick skull in a spray of green matter and bone fragments. The second and third rounds find similar marks in the orcs immediately behind. Precision killing. The work I was created for. But there are too many. They flow around their fallen like a river around stones, barely slowing. I empty the boulder in a controlled rhythm, each shot finding its mark, each mark falling. And still they come. The boulder clicks empty. Twenty-seven orcs dead, one hundred and eighty-five still charging. I maglock the weapon and bring the chainsword up in a defensive stance, my augmatic arm calculating the optimal angle to intercept the first attack. The orc that reaches me first is missing an eye. a ragged scar running from its forehead to its jaw. Its remaining eye gleams with feral intelligence. It swings a massive axe in an overhead arc that would split me from helm to groin if it connected. I sidestep with transhuman speed, the axe missing by centimeters, and bring my chainsword across in a horizontal slash that severs the orc's weapon arm at the elbow. Green blood sprays across my armor as the orc howls, more in rage than pain. Before it can recover, I reverse the chainsword's direction and drive it up through the Xenos' jaw and into its brain. The beast spasms, then goes limp. I kick it away, already turning to meet the next attacker. They come in a wave, three orcs reaching me simultaneously. My augmatic eye highlights weak points in their crude armor, calculating kill probabilities with cold precision. I move accordingly, the chainsword becoming an extension of myself, a blur of adamantium teeth that rends green flesh and crude metal with equal ease. One orc falls, its chest cavity opened from neck to navel. Another loses its head entirely, the chainsword catching it at the precise junction of jaw and neck. The third manages to land a glancing blow with a spiked club, the impact registering as minor damage to my left poldron. I kill it with a straight thrust through its right eye socket, the chainsword's teeth liquefying its brain before I withdraw the weapon in a shower of viscera. For two minutes and forty-three seconds, I maintain combat effectiveness. My movements are precise, economical, lethal. The chainsword claims seventeen more greenskins. I crush the windpipe of another with my augmatic hand. I smash the skull of a smaller orc against a boulder. I am the Emperor's wrath. I am death incarnate. and then something changes. An orc larger than the others, its skin a darker shade of green, pushes through the mass of its fellows. It carries a massive, two-handed hammer that hums with unstable energy. A power weapon, no doubt looted from one of my fallen brothers. In its crude hands, the noble weapon looks obscene. "'Marine. It bellows, its voice deeper and more articulate than its kind usually manage. "'Use fight-gud, boss wants your ed. The other orcs fall back, forming a crude circle around us. "'Some primitive concept of honor, perhaps? Or simply their enjoyment of spectacle? "'It matters not. The large orc grins, revealing metal-capped tusks that gleam dully in the fading light. "'I am Nob Grimskar.' It says, thumping its chest with its free hand. I's gonna be Da-1 what kills Da-last metal, Umi. I say nothing. Words are wasted on Xenos. Instead, I analyze my opponent, larger than standard orc specimens, but not yet a war boss. Enhanced musculature suggests experience and numerous successful combats. The power hammer is the greater threat, capable of breaching even Astarte's armor with a direct hit. I raise my chainsword in challenge. The orc roars and charges, covering the distance between us with surprising speed. The hammer comes down in a devastating arc. I pivot left, feeling the displacement of air as the weapon misses me by millimeters. Counter-attacking, I slash at the orc's exposed flank, the chainsword biting deep, but orcs are resilient. Despite a wound that would incapacitate most enemies, Grimscar merely grunts and swings the hammer in a horizontal sweep. I duck beneath it, But the Orc anticipates this, bringing its knee up into my helmet with bone-jarring force. Warning indicators flash across my display. Minor cranial trauma. Nothing that impedes combat functionality. I roll backward, creating space to reassess. The Orc is faster than its bulk suggests. It presses the attack, the power hammer leaving trails of disruptive energy in the air. Each swing forces me to give ground. Each near miss sends feedback warnings through my armor's systems. For one minute and twelve seconds, we dance this lethal dance. I land three more hits with the chainsword, each drawing green blood but failing to slow my opponent. The orc lands one glancing blow with the hammer against my left paltron, the impact cracking the ceramite, and sending pain signals from the interface with my organic shoulder. Why you fight so hard, Yumi? The orc asks during a momentary lull. You's already dead. All your metal brothers is dead. I respond with a thrust aimed at its throat. The orc parries with the haft of the hammer and laughs, a booming sound that seems to please the watching greenskins. De flesh is weak, right? That's what you metal armies always say. The orc's crude approximation of sacred iron hands doctrine is an abomination, but orcs is made of flesh and we's winin. With that, it launches a new assault, the hammer becoming a blur of motion. I parry, dodge, counter when possible. But the Orcs' words have done what its weapon could not. They have penetrated my defenses. The flesh is weak, our chapter's core belief. And yet, these creatures of pure flesh and bestial instinct have overwhelmed us. Killed my brothers, pushed me to the brink of destruction. What does that say about our doctrine? This moment of philosophical uncertainty costs me dearly. My reaction time slows by 0.3 seconds and eternity in combat. The power hammer catches me on my right side, even a glancing blow is catastrophic. I feel the ceramite of my armor buckle, feel the augmatic interface of my right arm tear free from flesh, Warning signals flood my helm's display as the arm goes completely offline, hanging useless at my side. The chainsword falls from suddenly nerveless fingers. I stagger, systems attempting to compensate for the damage. The orc sees its advantage and presses forward, hammer raised for the killing blow. In desperation, I lunge forward, inside the arc of the hammer's swing, My left hand, still organic beneath its gauntlet, finds the Orc's throat. Transhuman muscles squeeze with all their remaining strength. The Orc's eyes bulge. It drops the hammer to grab at my arm with both hands, its strength enormous even as it chokes. I feel the ceramite of my gauntlet crack under the pressure. Feel the bones of my organic hand begin to fracture. We stand locked together, neither able to break free, neither willing to yield. The watching orcs roar their approval, pounding crude weapons against makeshift shields in a deafening rhythm. My armor's systems continue to flash warnings, power levels critical, multiple system failures imminent. The damage to my augmatic arm has triggered cascading failures throughout my systems. Even if I survive this immediate combat, my chances of survival beyond the next 30 minutes are minimal. The Ork's grip weakens fractionally, as oxygen deprivation begins to affect even its resilient physiology. I redouble my efforts, ignoring the pain as more bones crack in my hand. The creature's eyes begin to roll back. Victory is close. Then the unexpected happens. The Ork smiles. Through its oxygen-starved stupor, it fixes me with a look of pure, animal joy. It is dying, and it knows it. But it is dying in combat, weapon in hand, facing a worthy enemy. For an orc, there is no better death. This realization strikes me with unexpected force. The green skin welcomes its end, embraces it, finds meaning in it, While I, a son of the Gorgon, augmented with the perfection of the machine, fear my approaching death. The irony is, I search for the word, bitter. With a final surge of strength, I crush the Orc's windpipe completely. Its smile never falters as the light fades from its eyes. When I release my grip, the massive body falls heavily to the ash-covered ground. I retrieve my chainsawed with my remaining functional hand. The circle of watching orcs has gone silent. They look from their fallen champion to me, their tiny minds processing this unexpected outcome. Then, as one, they begin to laugh. Not the mocking laughter of victory, but the genuine appreciation of a species that values strength above all else. They have witnessed a good fight, a proper kill. In their primitive way, they are honoring both their fallen champion and me. The largest of the remaining orcs steps forward. It wears a crude approximation of Imperial officers' garb over its mismatched armor, including what appears to be a naval captain's hat perched incongruously atop its massive head. Dat was proper fightin, metal Yumi. It says, looking down at the fallen Narb. Grimskar was me best Narb. Now he's dead, and you still standin. It fixes me with a red-eyed stare. Boss wants to fight you now. The war boss. The circle of orcs widens as the green skins fall back in obvious deference. From beyond their ranks, I hear heavy footfalls, the sound of metal scraping against metal, the low rumbling growl of poorly maintained power systems. My autosenses pick up the approaching threat before my organic eye can perceive it. Mass readings consistent with a significantly augmented orc specimen. Energy signatures suggesting multiple looted power systems. Heat blooms indicating active weapons. the circle parts and i understand why my brothers died why kathos prime has fallen the war boss stands nearly four meters tall but it is not its size that gives me pause it is what the greenskins have done to their leader Where standard orcs might incorporate crude bionics or scavenge technology, this monster has been extensively modified. Its right arm has been replaced with what appears to be a looted Sentinel's multi-laser, the weapon incongruously small in the massive creature's grasp yet still deadly. Its left arm ends in an enormous power claw that crackles with unstable energy. One, her leg is entirely mechanical. The crude hydraulics hissing with each step. Its head is encased in a metal shell reminiscent of an Imperial Knight's helm, a single red lens glowing where its left eye should be. It is a mockery of everything the iron hands stand for, a crude, Zenos attempt at the union of flesh and machine. And yet, as it stomps toward me, I cannot deny its terrible effectiveness. I, Isa Wabos Mixmasher, the monstrosity announces, its voice emerging from a Vox grill set into its metal-encased jaw. You fought me, boys good. Now you's gonna fight me. I glance down at my useless augmentic arm, at the damage indicators still flashing across my helm's display. At the chainsword in my hand, its fuel reserves now critically low. The logical conclusion is inescapable. I cannot win this fight. And yet, I am Brother Sergeant Varen of the Iron Hands. I respond, my voice steady despite everything. In the name of the Emperor and Ferris Manus, I accept your challenge. The surrounding orcs erupt in a cacophony of cheers and bellowed wagers. The warboss flexes its power claw, the energy field around it intensifying. Good, it says simply. Then it attacks. The multi-laser on its arm winds as it charges. I dive to the side as a beam of coherent light scorches the ground where I stood. The chainsword roars in my hand as I close the distance, aiming for a gap in the crude armor protecting the orc's torso. The warboss is shockingly fast for its size. The power claw sweeps down, intercepting my attack. Adamantium teeth meet energy field with a shower of sparks and a scream of tortured metal. For a moment we are locked together, the the chainsword straining against the power claw. Then the energy field cuts through the chainsword's teeth. The weapon sputters, then dies, half its length sheared away cleanly. I discard the useless hilt and leap backward, narrowly avoiding the follow-up swing of the massive claw. Unarmed now, with one arm non-functional, and my armor, compromised, I face the inevitable. The warboss knows it too. It advances more slowly now, savoring the moment. You metal umis think you special. It says, the Vox Grill lending its voice an unnatural resonance. Cut in off your arms and legs. Putting metal bits in your heads. It taps its own mechanical eye with the tip of a claw. Orcs been doing dat for always. Difference is, we enjoy it. I back away, buying seconds, scanning my surroundings for anything that might serve as a weapon or advantage. There is nothing, only ash, rock, and the bodies of the dead. The flesh is weak, the Warboss continues, mimicking our sacred doctrine with crude accuracy. That's what you lot always sayin'. But you got it wrong. The multi-laser begins to glow as it charges again. Tar flesh, ain't weak. Tar flesh is fun. The beam lances out. I attempt to dodge, but my damage systems respond too slowly. The laser catches my left leg, vaporizing the ceramite and the augmatic limb beneath in a burst of superheated metal. I fall, my armor's stabilization systems unable to compensate for the sudden loss. Pain floods my neural interfaces. Warning signals cascade across my display, power armoring failing. Life support compromised. Catastrophic damage to multiple systems. The cold logic of the machine informs me that death is imminent. The war boss stands over me, its massive form blocking out the sky. The power claw descends slowly toward my chest, the energy field humming with deadly promise. Any last words? Metal Yumi? It asks, almost respectfully. I think of the Iron Fathers and their endless quest for mechanical perfection. I think of the rituals and the doctrines, the slow replacement of flesh with machine. I think of the coldness that has grown within me over the decades, the gradual numbing of all emotion save rage. I think of my brothers, dead on this emperor-forsaken world. They're augmentics as useless as their faith in the superiority of the machine. And I think of the orc, nob, dying with a smile on its bestial face. The flesh, I whisper through damaged vocalizers, is not weakness. The warboss tilts its metal-encased head as if genuinely curious. What was that? I will not give it the satisfaction of seeing my fear. With my remaining organic hand, I reach up and release the seal on my helmet. The ash-filled air of Carthos Prime floods my nostrils, acrid and burning. I pull the helmet free, letting it fall to the ground beside me. I look up at the warboss with my mismatched eyes, one organic, one augmatic. I do not flinch. I do not beg. I am Adeptus Astartes, a space marine of the Emperor's creation. I will die as I lived with dignity and purpose. The flesh. I say again, my voice stronger now, carried on my own breath rather than artificial vocalizers, is not weakness. The flesh feels. The flesh knows joy and pain and fear and triumph. The flesh lives, truly lives, in a way the machine never can. That is not weakness. That is humanity. The war boss stares down at me for a long moment. Then it throws back its head and laughs, a booming sound half organic roar, half mechanical static. Spoken like a proper orc. It says when its mirth subsides, maybe you metal Yumi's ain't so different after all. The power claw descends. I feel the energy field disrupt the molecular bonds of my armor, feel the adamantium fingers pierce my primary heart. Systems fail. Vision dims. The pain is extraordinary. As consciousness fades, I have one final thought. I die not as a machine, but as a man. Perhaps that is victory enough. My name is Brother Sergeant Varen of the Iron Hands. Remember me. But death did not come. The next sensation I register is pain. Not the clean, precise notifications of damaged systems that my augmentics provide, but raw, organic pain. My primary heart struggles against the foreign object impaling it. My secondary heart races to compensate. Blood fills my enhanced lungs. I taste copper on my tongue. The War Boss has, withdrawn its claw, leaving a ragged wound in my chest. It stands over me, observing with what appears to be curiosity. The surrounding orcs have fallen silent, watching their leader with nervous anticipation. Not yet, the War Boss says, its mechanical eye glowing brighter as it scans me. You die when I say you die, you me. I try to speak, but blood bubbles from my lips instead of words. The warboss makes a gesture, and two smaller orcs approach cautiously. They lift me with surprising care, mindful of the wound in my chest. My armor's weight seems to give them no trouble. They are stronger than they look, these green skins. Take him to de camp. The warboss commands. Put him with de UVVR ones. Other ones? The implication sends a jolt through my fading consciousness. Are there other survivors? Other iron hands captured rather than killed? Hope is irrational in this situation, illogical. And yet I feel it nonetheless. The orcs carry me down the ash dune, their movements jarring every wound. I slip in and out of consciousness, my enhanced physiology fighting to keep me alive despite catastrophic injuries. In my lucid moments, I observe our surroundings. The green-skin encampment sprawls across the valley below, a chaotic collection of crude structures built from scavenged materials, corrugated metal, plastile panels, pieces of imperial vehicles and buildings, and more disturbing, parts of Astarte's armor incorporated into walls and supports. My brothers, reduced to building materials. We pass clusters of smaller orcs engaged in incomprehensible activities. Some appear to be fighting each other for no discernible reason. Others tinker with looted weapons and vehicles. A group gathers around what looks like a cooking fire, roasting meat I refuse to identify. The orcs carrying me approach a structure larger than the others, distinguished by crude red symbols painted across its front. A medicé facility of sorts? The thought is both horrifying and absurd. Greenskin do not practice medicine as humans understand it. Inside, the stench hits me first. Blood, both human and orc. Excrement, burnt flesh, chemicals I cannot identify. My enhanced senses, normally an asset, become a torture device. I would vomit if my body still retained that reflex. The interior is dimly lit by flickering glow globes, likely looted from imperial facilities. In this uncertain light, I make out shapes that defy immediate comprehension. Tables covered with surgical implements, most crusted with dried blood, containers filled with unidentifiable fluids, and most disturbing tanks containing suspended organic matter bubbling with unknowable purpose put them over there comes a voice from the shadows not the war boss but another orc smaller its voice higher in pitch with du v v My carriers turn, giving me a view of the far side of the chamber. There, arranged in a row against the wall, are five space marines, my brothers. They are secured to crude metal frames, their armor removed in places to expose flesh and augmentics. Tubes and wires connect them to primitive machines that click and whir. All show signs of grievous injury. All appear unconscious. No, not all. The one at the end, his face visible in the dim light, has his eyes open. I recognize him. Brother Caevos, our heavy weapons specialist. His gaze meets mine as the orcs secure me to an empty frame beside him. Brother Sargent, he whispers, his voice barely audible even to my enhanced hearing. You still live. As do you, I respond, the words coming with difficulty through blood-filled lungs. Others, unconscious, perhaps in induced comas, the orc they call pain boy has been, experimenting on us. The implications turn my blood cold in a way no augmatic cooling system ever could. Orc medicine is notorious throughout the Imperium, brutal, primitive, and yet, sometimes, effective in its own horrific way. Why, I ask. Why keep us alive? Brother Kavos attempts what might be a smile, though on his damaged face it appears more as a grimace. The war boss is fascinated by our augmentics, by our chapter's devotion to replacing flesh with machine. It sees a kinship. The very concept is blasphemous, heretical, and yet, I cannot dismiss it entirely. The memory of the warboss, its crude bionics mimicking our sacred enhancements, rises unbidden in my mind. How long have you been here? I ask. Three days, by my count. The others were brought in before me. I was captured when our fallback position was overrun. Before he can say more, a hunched figure shambles into view. An orc, smaller than the Warriors, wearing what appears to be a blood-stained Medicaid coat over its mismatched armor. Crude surgical tools hang from a belt around its waist. Most disturbing is the mechanical contraption attached to its head, a series of lenses that click into place over its eyes as it peers at me. New Ones Awake, it says, its voice containing a disturbing note of clinical interest. Good. Doc Gutripper needs fresh parts. the orc pain boy then it approaches the lenses over its eyes whirring as they adjust it examines the wound in my chest with disturbing thoroughness primary pump damaged it mutters more to itself than to me secondary still functional interesting redundancy design It pokes at the wound with a filthy digit, could replace with Mechboy Special, maybe add extra pump, three better than two, yes? Do not touch me, Xenos Filth. I spit, though the effect is somewhat undermined by the blood that accompanies my words. The Painboy ignores my defiance, continuing its examination. It moves to my non-functional augmatic arm, prodding at the interface where the limb connects to my organic shoulder. Bad connection here. It says, human design inferior. Ork way better. Drill straight through bone. Bolt metal to meet. Hurts more but lasts longer. It chuckles, a sound like rocks in a grinder. Could fix. Could make better. I would rather die I tell it with all the conviction I can muster. For the first time, the Pain Boy seems to actually hear me. It looks directly into my eyes, its own visible through the magnifying lenses of its headgear. Not your choice, Metal Yumi, it says, an unsettling grin spreading across its tusked face. Boss says you stay alive. Boss says you get fixed. Doc Gutripper follows orders. Its grin widens, mostly. It turns away, shambling toward a bench covered in tools and unidentifiable mechanical components. The sight fills me with dread. Not fear, I tell myself. Space Marines know no fear. But dread, yes. The cold certainty that what comes next will be beyond my experience of pain. Brother Sargent, Kayevos whispers beside me. The Emperor protects. The familiar litany should bring comfort. It does not. Does he, brother? I respond, watching as the pain boy selects instruments of torture from its collection. I see no evidence of his protection here. Kayevos falls silent, perhaps shocked by my near blasphemy, or perhaps because he shares my doubt but lacks the courage to voice it. The Painboy returns, arms full of crude tools and mechanical components. It sets them on a small table beside my restraint frame, arranging them with unexpected care. Then it reaches for what appears to be a rusted, reciprocating sore. Anesthesia? It asks, almost conversationally. For a moment, I think it is offering mercy. Then it laughs. Ork joke, anesthesia for weaklings. Pain makes stronger. The saw roars to life, its teeth spinning with hungry anticipation. I brace myself for pain beyond imagining. But before the blade can touch my flesh, a commotion erupts outside the Medicaid tent. Shouts. The discharge of crude firearms. The distinctive sound of a power weapon activating. The pain boy hesitates, its head turning toward the noise. The saw idles in its hand, momentarily forgotten. Wait here. It says, apparently oblivious to the fact that I am securely restrained. It sets down the resentory, sore and shambles toward the entrance, drawing a crude pistol from its belt. The moment it exits, Brother Khaivos speaks urgently. Brother Sargent, listen carefully. We may have only moments. I turn my head to face him, noting that he is working his right hand against his restraints, the motion subtle but persistent. The pain boy has been careless, he continues. In its procedures, it has damaged the interface between my augmatic leg and the nerve connections. I can no longer feel or control the limb, but I can access its machine spirit directly through mental impulse. I understand immediately. All iron hands are taught to communicate directly with their augmetics, a skill that grows with experience and meditation." But to manipulate a disconnected limb through will alone that requires mastery is few attain. Can you free yourself? I ask. Not directly, but watch. Khaevos closes his eyes, his face a mask of concentration. For several seconds, nothing happens. Then, almost imperceptibly, his augmatic leg twitches. Another moment of stillness. Another twitch. Then, with sudden violence, the leg kicks outward with all the power of Astartes' hydraulics. The restraint holding the limb shatters. The leg drops, hanging awkwardly from Kyavos' organic thigh, but now free of its bonds. With methodical precision, he manipulates the limb to kick against the restraints holding his other leg, then his arms. In less than a minute, Brother Kavos stands free. He moves to me immediately, his gait uneven as he drags the unresponsive augmatic leg. With efficient movements, he releases my restraints. Can you stand, brother sergeant? I assess my condition with cold logic, primary heart severely damaged, right arm non-functional, left leg missing below the knee, multiple system failures throughout my armor. Combat effectiveness at less than 15%. No, I admit. But that is irrelevant. Free the others if you can. Find weapons. Escape." Kayavos shakes his head. Not. Without you, brother sergeant. That is an order, brother. The mission takes priority over any individual. With respect, the mission failed days ago. We are all that remains of the fifth company on this world. Our duty now is to survive, to bring word back to the chapter. Before I can respond, the sounds of combat outside intensify, Explosions rock the structure. The crack of bolt-fire distinctive among the cruder orc weapons registers clearly to our enhanced hearing. Imperial forces? I suggest, hope warring with logic. Khaivos moves to the entrance, peering cautiously outside. He turns back to me, his expression unreadable. No, he says, another Orc tribe. They bear different markings from our captors, green and yellow, where these wear red and black. A green-skinned civil war, typical. Orcs fight among themselves as readily as they fight other species. Their constant internecine warfare is one of the few things that prevent them from overrunning the galaxy entirely. This may be our only opportunity, Kavos says, returning to free the other brothers. One by one, he releases them from their restraints. Two are indeed comatose, their life signs barely registering. One is conscious but delirious, mumbling litanies and prayers. The last, brother Tharnis appears relatively intact, though his right arm has been replaced with a crude orc bionic that twitches and whirs unpredictably. The pain boy was, experimenting, Tharnis explains, his voice flat with suppressed trauma, testing whether orc technology could interface with Astartes' physiology. The results were, mixed. I note the orc arm responds to his impulses, if erratically. Another time, I might find the theological implications disturbing a son of Ferris Manus bearing Xenos technology. Now, I care only that it might aid our escape. Can you fight with that limb? I ask. Tharnis flexes the mechanical fingers, their movement jerky but functional, if necessary. It will be necessary, I tell him. You, and Brother Kayavos must secure weapons. Brother Tharnis, you will carry me. We will bring the two comatose brothers if possible, but they are secondary priorities. And what of Brother Menas? Kaevos asks, indicating the delirious Marine still muttering prayers. I assess the brother's condition. His pupils are uneven. Blood seeps from his ears. Neurological damage, severe and likely irreparable even with proper medicae attention. If he can walk, he comes with us. I decide. If not, grant him the Emperor's peace. Harsh, but necessary, we cannot carry three disabled brothers and hope to escape. Tharnis and Kaevos exchange looks, but do not question the order. Brother Menas proves able to stand with assistance, though his movements are uncoordinated, and he seems unaware of his surroundings. The two Komato's brothers, regrettably, must be left behind. Kaevos administers the Emperor's peace with solemn efficiency, two quick blows to the primary hearts that ensure our brother's gene seed will not fall into Zeno's hands. With Tharnis supporting me and Kyvos guiding the semi-conscious menace, we move toward the entrance. The sounds of battle have intensified. Through the open flap, I glimpse orcs fighting orcs in a chaotic melee. Blood and body parts fly, crude vehicles burn. It is carnage of the most elemental kind. Wait, I command, an idea forming. Brother Tharnis, search the Painboy's equipment. Find anything that might serve as a distraction or weapon. Tharnes props me against a support beam and moves to comply. He returns moments later with an assortment of items, a few orc stick bombs, some unidentifiable chemical vials, and most promisingly, what appears to be a remote detonator. The Pain Boy had explosive charges set throughout the camp, Tharnes explains. Insurance against mutiny, I believe. This should trigger them. I take the detonator, examining it with both organic and augmatic eyes. Crude, but effective, typical orc technology. It might just work. New, plan, I announce. We wait until the battle reaches its peak, then detonate the charges. In the confusion, we make our way to the vehicle pool. If the Emperor smiles upon us, we may find something functional. My brothers nod, the logic of the plan evident. We position ourselves near the entrance, waiting for the optimal moment. The battle outside ebbs and flows, but gradually intensifies as more orcs join from both factions. I observe the conflict with tactical detachment. The invading green skins wear green and yellow, as Kyvos reported. They are smaller on average than our captors but appear more numerous. Their vehicles are lighter, faster, with less armor but more speed. A different philosophy of warfare, if such a term can be applied to orc tactics. When the fighting reaches what I judge to be maximum intensity, with both sides fully committed and attention focused entirely on the battle, I press the detonator. For a moment, nothing happens. I experience an irrational flicker of disappointment. Then the world explodes. Charges detonate in sequence across the camp. Structures collapse. Vehicles erupt in fireballs. Orcs are thrown through the air, many in pieces. The Medicaid tent shudders with the concussive force but remains standing, its construction sturdier than most. Now, I command, we move as one, emerging into chaos. Orcs run in all directions, many on fire, none paying attention to four injured space marines. The air is thick with smoke and ash, providing additional concealment. Kaevos has found crude weapons for himself, and Tharnus a salvaged boulder with a cracked casing for himself, a heavy orc cleaver for Tharnus. Brother Menas stumbles along beside them, still mumbling but at least ambulatory. I direct them toward where I recall seeing the vehicle pool during my entry to the camp. Tharnis carries me with his organic arm, the orc-orgmatic one clutching the cleaver. My own remaining organic arm holds the boulder Kyavos recovered for me, though with only seven rounds remaining, it is more symbol than practical weapon. We encounter three orcs en route, all disoriented from the explosions. Kyavos dispatches them with efficient boulder bursts before they can sound an alarm. The vehicle pool, when we reach it, is partially destroyed by the detonations, but several conveyances remain intact. There, I indicate a looted Imperial Chimera transport. The venerable machine has been defaced with orc glyphs and crude modifications, but its essential structure appears sound. More importantly, its engine block seems intact. Kavos moves to the vehicle, examining it with a technical eye. Fuel levels adequate, engine modified but functional. The machine spirit may be offended by the Zenos tampering, but it should serve our purpose. Brother Manas in first. I order. Then me. Brother Tharnis, you will drive. Brother Khaevos, provide covering fire if necessary. They comply without question, loading us into the defiled transport. The interior reeks of orc, a stench my enhanced senses catalog in unwelcome detail. Crude modifications abound, but the essential controls remain recognizable, Tharnis takes the driver's position, his organic hand on the steering column, the Orc-Org-Metic awkwardly manipulating the gears. The engine roars to life on the third attempt, a sound that brings unexpected relief. Kayevos climbs aboard, taking position at the pintle-mounted heavy stubber, another imperial weapon defiled by Orc hands. Which direction, brother sergeant? Tharnes asks as he engages the transmission. I consider our options. The Ork camp lies in a valley surrounded by ash dunes. Beyond those dunes stretch the wastes of Carthos Prime, hundreds of kilometers of ash and rock before the nearest Imperial outpost. Our chances of crossing that distance in our condition are minimal, and yet, what choice do we have? North, I decide, toward the mountains. If memory serves, there was an automated monitoring station in the foothills. It may have survived the initial orc assault. If we can reach it, we might be able to send a distress signal. Tharnis nods and guns the engine. The Chimera lurches forward, crushing the body of a fallen orc beneath its tracks. We pick up speed, heading for the northern edge of the camp. For a moment, it seems we might escape without further confrontation. Then an orc voice bellows over the din of continuing battle. D are Yumi's, D's are Scapon. I turn my head to see the war boss, Mechsmasher, standing atop a burning structure. Its augmatic eye glows red in the smoky darkness, fixed directly on our fleeing vehicle. It raises its multi-laser arm, the weapon whining as it charges. Evasive action! I shout. Tharnis swerves the Chimera just as the laser fires. The beam cuts through the space we occupied a second earlier, melting a rock formation to slag. Kavos returns fire with the stubber, the heavy rounds pinging ineffectually off the warboss's armored hide. Faster, I urge. We need distance. Tharnis pushes the engine harder. The Chimera responds with a mechanical roar, picking up speed as we head for the edge of the camp. Behind us, I hear the Warboss bellowing orders, rallying its forces despite the ongoing battle with the rival tribe. we clear the perimeter of the camp, the chimera bouncing violently as it hits the uneven terrain of the ash dunes. Every impact sends pain shooting through my damaged body, but I suppress the signals with practiced mental discipline. They're following, Kayavos reports from his position at the rear weapon. Three light vehicles, buggies or warbikers. Pursuit then, I had expected nothing less, Can you target their drivers? Kyavos fires a burst from the Stubber. Difficult. The vehicle is unstable, and the Stubber's sights are misaligned. Typical Orc craftsmanship. Do what you can. Brother Tharnis, maintain maximum speed. Our only advantage is the Chimera's superior durability compared to their lighter vehicles. We race across the preys. Ash plains, the Chimera's tracks kicking up great clouds behind us. The pursuing orc vehicles slowly gain ground, their lighter weight and more powerful engines giving them the advantage in open terrain. Cuyahoga fires in controlled bursts, conserving ammunition. One burst finds its mark. sending an orc warbike tumbling in a spectacular crash. The others continue the pursuit, now close enough that I can hear their crude engines over the roar of our own. They're moving to flanking positions, Kavos warns, classic envelopment tactic. The orcs may be crude, but they understand the basics of vehicular combat. If they get alongside us, they can force us to stop or crash. Brother Tharnis, prepare for evasive maneuvers on my mark. I instruct. Brother Chiavos, focus fire on the vehicle to our right when it approaches. Both brothers acknowledge the orders. I watch through the vision slit as the orc buggies accelerate, one moving to each side of our chimera. They are close enough now that I can see the green skins manning the crude guns mounted on their vehicles. Their tusked mouths open in war cries I cannot hear over the engine noise. Now, I command. Tharnest jerks the steering column hard to the right, directly toward the approaching buggy. The orc driver, clearly expecting us to veer away, has no time to react. The Chimera's armored bulk slams into the lighter vehicle, sending its spinning out of control. I glimpse the orcs being thrown clear as their buggy rolls, then explodes in a satisfying fireball. One down, I announce. But the maneuver has cost us speed. The other is still pursuing. Indeed, the remaining buggy has adjusted its approach, now staying directly behind us where our heavier vehicles turning disadvantage is most pronounced. Its forward gun, some manner of automatic weapon, opens fire. Rounds ping off the Chimera's rear armor. The armor will hold for now, Kyavos reports, returning fire. But they're targeting the engine block. If they hit, something vital. He doesn't need to finish the thought. Without the Chimera, our chances of survival drop to effectively zero. Options? I ask. My tactical mind evaluating and discarding possibilities. Brother Menas, who has been silent except for his muttered prayers since our escape, suddenly speaks with unexpected clarity. The river, he says, pointing through the forward vision slit. The Ash River. I follow his gesture and see it a dark line cutting across the ash plane ahead. Not water, but a flow of semi-molten ash from the volcanic activity that gives Carthos Prime its distinctive terrain. These ash rivers move slowly but are hot enough to melt ceramite with prolonged exposure. Can we cross it? I ask, uncertain whether Menace's suggestion comes from tactical awareness or his damaged mind. Tharnis studies the approaching feature. The Chimera might manage it if the flow isn't too deep. Its tracks provide better traction than the Ork Buggy's wheels. A calculated risk, then. Proceed, brother. Take us across. Tharnis adjusts our course, heading directly for a section of the Ash River that appears marginally narrower than the surrounding flow. The pursuing orc buggy follows, either unaware of the danger or confident in its ability to negotiate the obstacle. As we approach the river, I can feel the heat radiating through the Chimera's armor. Temperature warnings flash across my helm's display. The vehicle slows as Tharnis gauges the crossing point. Brace for high temperature and unstable terrain, he warns, then guns the engine. The Chimera lurches forward into the ash flow. Immediately, warning indicators scream throughout the vehicle. The cabin temperature spikes. The tracks grind against the semi-solid material, struggling for purchase. For a heart-stopping moment, I think we might become mired in the flow, trapped until the heat melts through the hull. Then the tracks bite and we begin to move forward. Slowly, agonizingly slowly, but moving, nonetheless. The Chimera groans with the strain, its engine roaring at maximum output. Through the rear vision slit, I see the orc buggy pause at the edge of the flow, its driver clearly reconsidering the pursuit. They're turning back, Kyavos reports with grim satisfaction. Indeed, the orc vehicle is reversing, seeking an alternate route. But our victory is short-lived. Beyond the buggy, a larger dust cloud approaches rapidly. Through my augmatic eyes magnification, I identify the source, a looted Imperial Lehman Rust tank, heavily modified with orc additions. Atop it stands a familiar figure the Warboss Mexmasher. Increase speed if possible. I order. We need to clear the flow before they bring that cannon to bear. Tharnis pushes the straining engine harder. The Chimera responds with reluctant progress, now halfway across the Ash River. The heat inside the cabin has become nearly unbearable, even for Astarte's physiology. Warning runes indicate the outer hull is approaching material failure temperatures. Almost there, Tharnis grunts, his concentration absolute. The front of the Chimera reaches the opposite bank, its tracks finding purchase on solid ground once more. With renewed traction, we begin to accelerate out of the flow. Behind us, I hear the distinctive sound of a battle cannon firing. Incoming! Khaivos shouts. The shell impacts the ash river just behind our vehicle. The explosion sends a wave of molten material washing over the chimera's rear. Metal screams as it melts. The engine sputters, then dies. Its cooling systems overwhelmed. but momentum carries us forward onto solid ground and clear of the ash flow. We coast to a stop, the Chimera now a smoking, partially melted wreck, but we have crossed the barrier. On the opposite bank, the war boss roars its frustration, unable to follow immediately. Status? I demand. Engine destroyed. Tharnis reports. The Chimera will move no further. Brother Menace? Kyavos checks the other marine. Alive. But, his condition is deteriorating. The heat has exacerbated his injuries. I make another hard decision. We continue on foot. The monitoring station is approximately 20 kilometers north. If we maintain maximum sustainable pace, we can reach it before local dawn. Brother Sergeant, Kevo says hesitantly. Your injuries are irrelevant. I cut him off. You will support Brother Menas. Brother Tharnis will assist me. We move now, before the orcs find a crossing point. They do not argue further. With mechanical efficiency, we exit the ruined Chimera. Tharnis helps me stand on my remaining leg, my arm across his shoulders. Kaevos similarly supports Brother Menas, who has lapsed back into his delirious state. Thus begins the most grueling march of my long service. Twenty kilometers across ash plains, injured with minimal equipment and the certainty of pursuit. Every step sends pain signals cascading through my damaged systems. Every breath burns in my punctured lung. But I do not falter. I am iron hands. I endure. We establish a sustainable pace, slow by Astarte's standards, but faster than un-augmented humans could manage in peak condition. The ash plains stretch before us, featureless except for occasional rock formations and the distant outline of mountains to the north. For three hours we march without incident. Then Chiavos, whose augmatic eye includes enhanced surveillance capabilities, detects movement behind us. Orcs, he confirms. They've crossed the Ash River approximately four kilometers back. Light vehicles, moving fast. I assess our position. We have covered nearly half the distance to the monitoring station, but remain fully exposed on the open plain. There is no terrain feature nearby that offers defensive possibilities. We continue, I decide. Maximum speed now. If they catch us in the open, we make our stand there. We increase our pace, pushing our damaged bodies to their limits. Brother Menas stumbles more frequently, his condition visibly. Worsening. the distance to our pursuers steadily decreases after another kilometer tharness spots something ahead ruins he reports imperial construction partially buried in ash i focus my augmatic eye on the location he indicates indeed the remains of what appears to be an imperial installation rise from the ash approximately two kilometers ahead not our intended destination but perhaps a defensible position Adjust course. I order. We make for the ruins. We alter direction slightly, now moving directly toward the buried structure. Behind us, the orc vehicles continue to gain ground. I estimate they will reach us shortly before we attain the ruins. Another decision point approaches. Brothers, I say, my voice steady despite the pain of movement, we cannot outrun them. Caevos, you are the least injured. Take Brother Menas and proceed to the ruins at maximum speed. Tharnas and I will delay the pursuit. Kavos begins to object. That is an order, brother. The mission is to return to the chapter with intelligence on this Orc force. One of us must survive to deliver that information. Kavos holds my gaze for a moment, then nods sharply. Iron within, iron without, brother Sargent. Iron within, iron without, I respond. Now go. Kevos adjusts his grip on the semi-conscious Menas and breaks into an Astarte's combat run, quickly pulling ahead. Tharnis helps me turn to face our pursuers, now visible as dust clouds on the horizon. A worthy end, brother Sargent, he says, readying his orc cleaver. If the Emperor wills it, I respond. Then, after a pause, Brother Tharnis, you should go with them. There is no logic in both of us dying here. Tharnis looks down at me, his expression unreadable behind his helm. Then he removes the helmet, revealing a face more machine than man. Augmatic jaw, bionic left eye, metal plates grafted to his skull. No, brother Sargent, he says simply. The flesh is weak, but brotherhood endures. The brotherhood endures. Words strike me with unexpected force. Throughout my service with the iron hands, I have pursued the chapter's doctrine of mechanical perfection with single-minded devotion. I have replaced healthy flesh with augmetics in the belief that doing so made me stronger, better, more worthy of serving the emperor. I have judged my brothers by the extent of their modifications, equating metal with merit. And yet, here at the end, it is not the machine that gives Tharnis strength, it is something else entirely. Something I have perhaps forgotten in my quest for cold perfection. The Ork vehicles are close now, close enough to identify three buggies and several war bikers. No sign of the war boss at least. Small mercy. Tharnis props me against a rock formation, allowing me to bring my borrowed boulder to bear. Seven rounds remain. Seven kills if the Emperor guides my aim. It has been an honor, brother Tharnis. I tell him, sincerity flooding my voice. The honor has been mine, brother Sergeant Varen, he responds. Then, with unexpected gentleness, the chapter will remember us. The orcs are within range now. My first bolt round takes the lead biker in the face, detonating inside its skull in a spray of green matter. The second rider swerves to avoid its falling comrade and drives directly into my third shot. Four rounds remaining. Tharnis braces himself as the first buggy approaches, its crude ram lowered to impale him. At the last possible moment, he sidesteps with Astarte's speed, bringing the orc cleaver down in a powerful arc that severs the driver's arm at the shoulder. The vehicle careens out of control, crashing into a rock formation. The second buggy skids to a halt, its occupants disembarking to engage us directly. Five orcs, all heavily armed, spread out to surround us. I use my fourth bolt round to remove the apparent leader's head, then swivel to take down another with my fifth. The third falls to my sixth round as it charges Tharnis from behind. One round left. Tharnis is magnificent in combat, even with his mismatched arms. The Orc-Og-Metic, seemingly responding to his battle fury, becomes more synchronized with his movements. He cleaves through one green skin, then another, green blood spraying across his armor. For a brief, irrational moment, I believe we might survive. Then the third buggy crests a nearby ash dune, and I see the heavy weapon mounted on its frame, a looted heavy boulder, its barrel already spinning up to firing speed. Tharnes is engaged with the last orc from the second buggy, his back to the new threat. I have one bolt round remaining, time seems to slow as I make my decision. With perfect clarity, I raise the bolter and fire my final round. Not at the orcs engaging tharness, but at the heavy bolters ammunition feed. The bolt round detonates inside the feed mechanism, causing a chain reaction that explodes the entire weapon and the buggy carrying it. Tharnis dispatches his opponent with a brutal overhead strike, then turns to witness the destruction of the third buggy. He nods to me in acknowledgement of the shot, then tenses as more orc vehicles appear on the horizon. "'More coming,' he reports unnecessarily. I discard the now empty bolter. How many? Too many. Indeed, a veritable convoy of orc vehicles approaches a mixture of buggies, bikes, and larger transports. At their center rides the warboss on its looted Leman Rus, the tank's battle cannon elevating as it prepares to fire. We have done what we can, brother, I tell Tharnis. Kavos and Menas should have reached the ruins by now. Our duty is fulfilled. Tharnis nods, taking up position beside me, his cleaver held ready though we both know it will make no difference against what approaches. Any final words, brother Sargent? I consider the question. Throughout my service, I have memorized countless litanies and prayers, doctrinal statements and tactical axioms. But none seem appropriate now. Instead, I find myself returning to the realization that struck me during my duel with the Ork Nob. The flesh is not weakness, Brother Tharnes, I say finally. It is what makes us human, even as we are transhuman. And in the end, it is our humanity that the Emperor wishes us to preserve, not just our strength. Tharnis considers this, then nods slowly. A worthy epitaph, brother sergeant. The warboss's tank halts 500 meters away. The battle cannon fires. I have often wondered how I would meet my end. In the service of the iron hands, death in battle is expected, even embraced. but I had always imagined it differently, perhaps in a glorious charge, or holding a crucial position to the last, or striking down a worthy enemy even as they struck me down in turn. Instead, I watched the shell arc toward us with perfect, mechanical calm. There is no fear, no regret. Only a strange sense of completion, as if a question I have been asking my entire service has finally been answered. The shell impacts 20 meters from our position. The world goes white, then black. I am dead. I must be. And yet, awareness returns. Pain returns. The sensation of ash in my throat, the taste of blood in my mouth, the warnings still flashing across my helm's display. I live, though I cannot immediately understand how. My vision clears gradually. I lie half buried in ash, thrown some distance by the explosion. Of Brother Tharnis, I see no sign. The orc vehicles are closer now, close enough to make out individual green skins standing on their hulls or hanging from their sides. The warboss's tank has stopped firing, perhaps saving ammunition now that victory seems assured. Then something else enters my field of vision. A boot. Ceramite. Imperial manufacture, though scored and damaged. I follow the leg upward, confirming what seems impossible another space marine. Not one of my brothers, but a warrior in different heraldry. Black armor with white trim, a white skull on the paldron. Deathwatch. Brother Sergeant Varen of the Iron. Hands, the Marine asks, his voice emerging from an unmarked helm. I am, I respond, my vocalizer struggling to form the words. I am Brother Lieutenant Carvis, kill team obsidian. We detected your signal. Signal? I understand suddenly. The monitoring station we were heading for. Kaevos must have reached it, activated the emergency beacon, but how had the Deathwatch responded so quickly? As if reading my thoughts, Carvas continues, We were already in system tracking this Ork invasion force. Your signal confirmed our intelligence that the Greenskins had advanced this far into the sector. He gestures, and two more Deathwatch Marines appear, lifting me with careful strength. As they raise me, I see the broader situation. A Deathwatch Strike Cruiser hovers in the sky above, its silhouette unmistakable. Drop pods and thunderhawks dot the landscape. Dozens of black-armored marines engage the Orc forces, their specialized weapons cutting through the Xenos with brutal efficiency. My brothers, I say urgently. Two survivors. They reach the ruins ahead. Recovered, Carvis confirms. Both alive. Though the one called Menas is in critical condition. we have an apothecary attending them relief floods through me an emotion i would once have suppressed as weakness now i embrace it and brother tharness carvis hesitates we found no other survivors at this position brother sergeant i am sorry I absorb this information. Logic tells me Tharnis could not have survived the shell impact at such close range, and yet, I find myself unwilling to accept this conclusion without evidence. I must find him, I insist, struggling against the Death Watch Marine's grip. Brother Sergeant, your injuries. Carvis begins. I must find him, I repeat, with all the authority I can muster. After a moment's hesitation, Carvis nods to his Marines, who help me stand on my remaining leg. We will search, Carvis concedes. But quickly, the warboss is rallying its forces for a counter-attack. Supported between the two Deathwatch Marines, I scan the area. The shell impact has created a shallow crater, surrounded by scattered debris and ash. Nothing immediately identifiable as a space marine. Then I see it a glint of metal in the ash, reflecting the dim sunlight. I direct the Marines toward it. As we approach, more details emerge from the ash. Ceramite fragments, the remains of a power pack, and finally, a gauntleted hand protruding from the ash. There, I say, pointing, the Deathwatch Marines help me to the location. Together, we brush away the ash covering what remains of Brother Tharnis. The shell impact has destroyed most of his body. His legs are gone. His chest armor is shattered, the organic components beneath unrecognizable. But remarkably, his head and right shoulder remain relatively intact. Most surprising of all, his eyes are open. As I lean closer, they focus on me. Brother Sargent, he whispers, his voice barely audible even to my enhanced hearing. You live. as do you brother i respond marveling at his tenacity somehow a wet sound emerges from what remains of his vocalizer it takes me a moment to recognize it as laughter not for long he says systems failing but i heard what you said about the flesh I nod, placing my remaining hand on his poldron. The flesh is not weakness. Not weakness, he agrees. His eyes flicker, power failing. But iron. Iron endures. With those words, the light fades from his eyes. Brother Tharnes, veteran of the Iron Hand's fifth company, passes to the Emperor's side. Iron within, iron without, I murmur, closing his eyes with gentle fingers. The Deathwatch Marines give me a moment, then speak urgently. Brother Sergeant, we must evacuate. The War Boss is advancing. I look up to see the Orc forces regrouping, recovering from their initial surprise at the Deathwatch's arrival. At their center, the unmistakable form of war boss Mexmasha stands atop its tank, roaring orders too. Its followers. Its augmatic eye seems to find me across the battlefield, the red lens flaring briefly. Take me to the extraction point, I tell the Marines. But first, help me retrieve his gene seed. Together, we perform the sacred duty, recovering the progenoid gland from Brother Tharnes' remains. The chapter's legacy preserved, even in defeat. Then they half carry, half drag me toward a waiting Thunderhawk, its engines already spooling up for rapid departure. As we board, I look back at the battlefield. The Death Watch are executing a fighting withdrawal, their discipline immaculate as they fall back in coordinated units. The orcs advance in their chaotic fashion, more concerned with being first into battle than with tactical coherence. The Thunderhawk lifts off, its engines roaring as it climbs rapidly into the ash-filled sky. Through the open bay door, I watch as the orc forces swarm over the area we just abandoned. Among them, the war boss stands out, its augmented form unmistakable even at this distance. It looks up at our departing craft, and for a moment, I imagine I can see frustration in its posture. The bay door closes, cutting off my view. I am guided to a crash seat and secured by the Death Watch Marines, my damaged form requiring special attention. Around me, other Thunderhawks rise from the surface of Carthos Prime, carrying the survivors of the kill team's operation. Brother Sergeant Varen, a voice addresses me. I turn to see a death-watch apothecary approaching, his armor marked with the distinctive medicay symbols of his office. I am brother apothecary Neeros. I need to stabilize your condition before we reach the strike cruiser. I nod, allowing him to examine my extensive injuries. His movements are precise, efficient, as he applies emergency field treatments to my most critical wounds." I note with detached interest that he treats the organic damage first, before turning his attention to my non-functional augmetics. Your primary heart has suffered severe trauma, he informs me clinically. I have administered stimulants and sealants to maintain function, but you will require extensive surgery once aboard. Your augmatic interfaces show significant degradation. The orc tampering has caused inflammation at several connection points. The orcs, I say, forcing the words through damaged vocalizers. What intelligence do you have on their force? The apothecary pauses in his work, studying me for a moment. That is not my concern, brother sergeant. My duty is to your recovery. Nevertheless, I persist. I must know. After a moment's hesitation, he continues his treatment while speaking. From what I understand, the Orc Force on Carthos Prime represents a significant evolution in green-skin technology integration. The War Boss Mechsmasher has developed unusually sophisticated bionics, beyond what we typically see even in advanced Orc Mechs. The Ordo Xenos believes it may have acquired this knowledge from captured Imperial tech priests. This confirms my observations. They were studying us. I tell him. The Iron Hands specifically. Our Augmetics. Our integration of flesh and machine. So I have been informed, he acknowledges. Your surviving brothers have already provided preliminary reports. The Inquisition will want a full debriefing once you are stabilized. The thought of the Inquisition's interest sends a chill through me that has nothing to do with my physical condition. Their scrutiny can be as dangerous as any Xeno's threat. The other survivors, I ask. Brothers Caevos and Menaz. Their condition? Brother Caevos is stable. His augmatic damage is repairable. Brother Menas. The apothecary hesitates. His neurological trauma is extensive. The brain damage may be beyond our ability to treat. Even if he survives, he may never again serve as a battle brother. I absorb this information with grim acceptance. Three survivors from a squad of twelve. A poor outcome by any tactical assessment. And yet, given what we faced, perhaps a miracle of sorts. Your chapter will be notified The Apothecary continues. The Iron Hands will dispatch a vessel to retrieve you and your brothers, along with the gene seed you recovered. The Iron Hands, my chapter, my brothers. I find myself wondering how they will receive the news of our defeat, how they will interpret my philosophical revelations during the battle. The Iron Fathers are not known for their tolerance of doctrinal questioning. The remainder of the flight passes in silence as the apothecary works. I drift between consciousness and a state of semi-awareness, my enhanced physiology, and the apothecary's treatments keeping me alive despite injuries that would have killed a normal human many times over. When awareness fully returns, I find myself in the Medicaid Bay of the Death Watch Strike Cruiser. The chamber hums with advanced medical equipment, servitors moving with quiet efficiency between treatment stations. I am secured to a surgical platform, numerous tubes and monitoring devices connected to my damaged form. He is conscious, a voice notes. A space marine in the black armor of the Death Watch approaches, though without a helmet. His features mark him as ultramarine, in origin broad, noble features, with the gene heritage of Gilliman, evident in his bearing. I am Captain Titus, commander of this Death Watch detachment. He introduces himself. You are fortunate, Brother Sergeant Varen. Few survive extended capture by the Greenskins. Fortune had little to do with it, Captain, I respond. My voice stronger now, the Medicaid treatments having restored some function to my vocalizers. It was the Emperor's will and the sacrifice of my brothers. Titus nods, accepting this. Of course, the Death Watch honors their sacrifice. He pauses, studying me with piercing eyes. The Iron Hands vessel Blood of Iron has responded to our astropathic message. They will rendezvous with us in approximately 72 hours to retrieve you and your surviving brothers. Three days. Three days before I must face my chapter and report our failure. Report the loss of most of the fifth company. Report my heresies. I am grateful for the Death Watch's intervention, Captain. I tell him sincerely. Without your arrival, none would have survived to bring word back to the chapter. We serve the Emperor's will," Titus responds simply. As do all Astartes. He hesitates, then continues. Brother Sargent, your surviving battle-brother, Kavos, has provided a preliminary report of your captivity. Of the Orcs' unusual interest in Iron Hand's bionics, the Ordo Xenos considers this development concerning. i suspected as much the warboss had extensively modified itself with crude approximations of our augmatic philosophy it spoke of our doctrine with a degree of understanding no orc should possess titus's expression darkens then it is as the inquisition feared the green skins are evolving their technological capabilities perhaps specifically to counter the iron hands This information will need to be shared with your chapter's leadership. I will provide a full report, I assure him. I have no doubt, he says, then changes the subject. The apothecaries inform me that your augmatic arm cannot be repaired with the resources available on this vessel. The interface has been too extensively damaged. Similarly, your leg will require complete replacement. These procedures will need to wait until you return to your chapter. I nod my acceptance of this assessment. And my primary heart? Stabilized, but weakened. You will need an extended period of recovery, possibly including induced hibernation, to allow for cellular regeneration. Again, this is best handled by your chapter's apothecaries, who are more familiar with your specific augmatic integration. In other words, I am alive but far from combat ready. the knowledge chafes though i understand its necessity a space marine exists to fight recuperation while necessary feels like a form of failure rest now brother sergeant captain titus advises the apothecaries will continue treatments to prepare you for transport when you are stronger I will return to discuss the tactical situation on Carthos Prime in more detail. With a respectful nod he departs, leaving me alone with my thoughts and the quiet movements of the Medicaid servitors. The next 72 hours pass in a blur of treatments, brief periods of consciousness, and longer stretches of medically induced sleep. During my waking hours, I provide what information I can to the Death Watch's intelligence officers. detailing the Orc forces, their tactics, and most importantly, their unusual technological adaptations. I speak with Brother Kavos once, briefly. He has fared better than I in physical terms, his injuries less severe, and his Augmetics less compromised by Orc tampering. But I see something in his eyes that concerns me a shadow that was not present before our captivity. The Iron Fathers will want to know everything, Brother Sargent. He tells me during our short conversation, about the orcs, about their interest in our bionics, about what you said on the battlefield. So he has reported my words, my questioning of the chapter's core doctrine. I am not surprised, nor do I blame him. It is his duty. I will tell them the truth, brother. I respond. All of it. Caiavos nods, his expression unreadable. The flesh is weak. He says, as if testing me. I hold his gaze steadily. But brotherhood endures, I respond, echoing Tharnes' final words rather than the traditional response. Kevo says nothing more, but I see uncertainty in his eyes as he leaves. On the third day, I am informed that the blood of iron has arrived. The Deathwatch Medicaid staff prepare me and the other survivors for transport, securing us in specialized medical stasis units for the journey to the Iron Hands vessel. As they close my stasis unit, I catch a glimpse of black-armored figures entering the Medi-K Bay. Not Deathwatch, but Iron Hands, their armor adorned with the distinctive iconography of the Iron Fathers, the spiritual and technological leaders of my chapter. They have come in person. That alone tells me how seriously they take the situation. The stasis field activates, and consciousness fades once more. I awake in familiar surroundings the medicaid deck of an iron-hand strike cruiser, the blood of iron, deliverer class, assigned to the fifth company, my company, or what remains of it. Iron Father Kern stands at my bedside, his face more machine than man, expression unreadable behind his extensive augmetics. Once, I found his appearance aspirational, the perfect melding of flesh and machine. Now, I see it differently though I keep this thought carefully hidden. Brother Sergeant Varen, he greets me, his voice a mechanical monotone. You have returned to the chapter. By the Emperor's grace, Iron Father, I respond formally. Indeed. He studies me, augmatic eyes whirring as they focus. Your injuries are extensive. The Apothecaries estimate six months of recovery before you can return to combat duties. longer if we implement the full range of recommended augmatic replacements, six months, an eternity, for a space marine. But I say nothing excepting the assessment with Stoic discipline. Your surviving battlebrothers have provided detailed reports of the events on Carthos Prime, Kyrne continues. The loss of most of the fifth company is a significant blow to the chapter. The Iron Council wishes to understand how such a defeat occurred. Here it comes, the scrutiny, the judgment, the cold calculation of failure. I am prepared to provide a full accounting, Iron Father, I tell him. That will not be necessary immediately, he says, surprising me. Your recovery takes priority. However, there is one matter I must address now. His augmatic eyes focus more intently. Brother Kaevos has reported certain philosophical discussions that occurred during your captivity and escape, specifically questions regarding our chapter's core doctrine. I consider my response carefully. I could deny it. Claim that trauma or orc tampering had affected my judgment. The Iron Fathers might accept such an explanation, but it would be a lie. I questioned the doctrine that the flesh is weak, I acknowledged directly. Based on my observations of the orcs, their resilience, despite their purely organic nature, and their crude but effective mimicry of our orgmatic approach, Iron Father Kern is silent for a long moment. When he speaks, his tone is unchanged. The Orc's interest in our Augmatic philosophy is concerning. It suggests a level of technological evolution previously unseen in their species. The Iron Council has determined that this represents a significant threat to the chapter and the Imperium. He is deflecting, focusing on the strategic implications rather than my doctrinal questioning. I press the point. Iron Father, with respect, the question remains. If the flesh is truly weak, how did creatures of pure flesh and bestial instinct overwhelm the fifth company? How did they adapt our sacred augmatic philosophy and turn it against us? Kern's augmatic eyes were again recalibrating as he studies me. You misunderstand our doctrine, brother sergeant. The flesh is weak is not merely a statement of physical comparison. It addresses the failings of emotion, of doubt, of the organic mind's tendency toward irrationality. The machine is logical, consistent, reliable. And yet, I counter, it was emotion that carried my brothers and me through our ordeal. Brotherhood, determination, even fear, channeled properly. These weaknesses gave us strength when logic dictated surrender. A temporary anomaly, Kern dismisses. The exception that proves the rule. I say nothing more. There is no point. The Iron Fathers have maintained their doctrine for ten thousand years. My experience on a single battlefield will not change their minds. But it has changed mine. Rest, Brother Sargent. Iron Father Kern says, apparently considering the discussion closed, When you have recovered sufficiently, the Iron Council will hear your full report. Until then, focus on your rehabilitation. The chapter requires your service. He turns to leave, then pauses. The gene seed you recovered from your fallen brothers has been properly processed. Their sacrifice will live on in future generations of Iron Hands. That, at least, was well done. With that meager praise, he departs, leaving me alone with my thoughts. Six months. Six months of recovery, of augmentic replacements, of physical rehabilitation. Six months to consider what I experienced on Carthos Prime, and what it means for my service to the chapter. The iron hands will never change their core doctrine. The flesh will always be weak in their eyes, the machine always superior. It is the foundation of our chapter's identity, our approach to warfare, our very existence. But as I lie here, feeling the pain in my remaining organic parts and the cold absence of sensation in my augmentics, I know that I have changed. The experience has transformed me in ways no bionic enhancement ever could. I will serve, I will fight, I will die if necessary for the Emperor and the Imperium, But I will never again believe that my humanity is a weakness to be excised. It is, perhaps, the only true strength we possess. The flesh feels pain, yes. It bleeds. It fails. It dies. But it also feels brotherhood, courage, determination. It feels purpose. The machine merely executes. The Orknob died with a smile on its face, embracing its end as the culmination of a life lived according to its nature. Can any of us, with all our augmentic enhancements, our technological superiority, our doctrinal purity, claim the same? I am brother Sargent Varen of the Iron Hands. I have looked into the face of defeat and found not weakness but humanity. The Iron Fathers would call this heresy. Perhaps it is. But it is my truth, forged in the crucible of Carthos Prime, tempered in the blood of my fallen brothers, and stronger than any augmatic they might graft to my failing flesh. The flesh is not weakness. It is what makes us human in a galaxy that constantly tries to strip our humanity away. And in the grim darkness of the far future, where there is only war, perhaps that is the only victory any of us can truly claim.

I remember the exact moment when the sky broke, not tore, not cracked but broke, like a mirror struck by a hammer. We had no warning. The Astronomicon flickered, a candle in a hurricane, and then vanished entirely. The choir of astropaths screamed all at once, their voices carrying across the city like a dirge. I was loading crates at the orbital docks, my hands numb from twenty hours of labor when it happened. A flash of violet light split the heavens, and for one terrible second I could see through reality itself. My name is Joran Malrek, I am a dock worker on the shrine world of Velsis. I was a dock worker, now I am something else. a witness perhaps, a survivor for now. I record these words on stolen parchment with ink made from ash and blood by the light of burning hab blocks. This account is meant for no one, there is no one left to read it, but still I write. It feels important somehow to document the end. Velsis was never an important world in the grand scheme of the Imperium. We were a waypoint, a place of minor pilgrimage, Our planet housed the remains of Saint Drusilla, who died here 8,000 years ago during the howling. The ecclesiarchy maintained a presence, of course. Gold adorned priests in their finery, preaching obedience and sacrifice while they grew fat on tithes. The planetary governor, Lady Vulture, ruled from her spire with calculated disinterest. The Arbites kept order. The merchants grew wealthy. The workers, like me, simply survived. We had a saying on Velsis, the god emperor protects, but the docks provide. Our world depended entirely on shipments from the agri-worlds of the Kaelis sector. Our own soil was barren, poisoned by whatever catastrophe had brought St. Drusilla here millennia ago. We grew nothing but pale fungus and stringy root vegetables in the underhive hydroponics chambers. Everything else came from the void. The ships brought grain, meat, textiles, promethium, medicae supplies. The ships brought life. When the sky broke, the ships stopped coming. The first day after the event, which some were already calling the sundering, there was confusion but little panic. Service interruptions happened occasionally. Warp storms would delay shipments for days, sometimes weeks. The Ecclesiarchy called for prayer. The Arbites increased patrols. The governor issued reassurances. I returned to the docks, where my overseer, Carrick, ordered us to continue unloading the last vessel that had made port before everything changed. Just temporary. Karak said, his oigmatic eye whirring as it focused on the manifests. Happened back in 887 too, lasted 19 days. We survived then. But there was something different in his voice, a tremor I had never heard before. And when I looked at the servitors working alongside us, I noticed they kept pausing, their flesh-metal hybrid bodies twitching as if receiving conflicting orders. That night, I returned to my HAB unit in the lower mid-spire. It was small but clean, with a single window overlooking the vast basilica of St. Drusilla. Usually, the basilica was illuminated by thousands of candles, its stained armor-glass windows glowing with scenes of imperial triumph. That night, it was dark, not completely, but enough to notice, as if they were rationing the light. My wife Linear worked in the basilica as a reliquary attendant. Her job was to dust the countless minor relics, to polish the display cases, to make sure the streams of pilgrims moved efficiently past the saints' withered corpse. When she returned home that night, her hands were bleeding. They made us remove the silver from the reliquaries, she said, her voice hollow. Anything that wasn't directly blessed by the saint. They're melting it down. Why? I asked, applying Medicae Unguant to her torn fingers. Cardinal mocks wouldn't say. But there are rumors. She looked toward the window, toward the darkened basilica. They say the Astronomicon has gone out. Not just here, but everywhere. They say we're alone now. I didn't believe it then. The Astronomicon was eternal. The Emperor's guiding light. It couldn't simply vanish. But I held linear close that night, and we both pretended not to notice when the power to our HAB block cut out for three hours. Just a temporary measure, the Vox announcement said. Just until the supply ships arrive. The second day brought the first real signs of trouble. The markets in the mid-spire, usually bustling with activity, were oddly subdued. Many stalls remained closed. Those that were open had doubled or tripled their prices overnight. I saw an old woman offering her wedding band for a sack of grain. The merchant refused. Metals no good to me if I starve, he said. At the docks, half my crew didn't show up for their shift. Carrick didn't seem surprised. He divided us into smaller teams and set us to inventorying the remaining supplies in the orbital warehouses. I was assigned to Warehouse 17, which held preserved meats. The smell was overwhelming, a combination of salt and chemicals designed to keep flesh from rotting during long warp journeys. As I counted crates, I realized we had perhaps two weeks of meat for the entire population of Velprimeris, our capital city. Two weeks, if strictly rationed. My counting partner was a man named Dolan, a fellow I'd worked alongside for years but barely knew. As we tallied the dwindling supplies, he leaned close to me. My cousin works in the governor's household, he whispered, says they're preparing her ship for departure. The governor's leaving? I asked. Too loudly. Dolan shushed me, his eyes darting to the servitor monitors in the corners of the warehouse. Not yet. But the ships being stocked. Only the best supplies. Fresh. Not preserved. And weapons. Lots of weapons. I wanted to dismiss it as rumor, but something in Dolan's frightened eyes told me it was true. The governor was preparing to abandon us. That evening, as I walked home through the mid-spire, I noticed increased Arbite's presence. They stood at major intersections, their armor gleaming, shotguns held at the ready. They weren't just patrolling, they were establishing a perimeter. The upper spires, where the wealthy and powerful resided, were being sealed off from the rest of the city. When I reached my Hab block, I found Linnea waiting outside, her face streaked with tears. they wouldn't let me leave the basilica. She said, Cardinal Mox gave a sermon about preparation and sacrifice. Then they locked the reliquary and told the attendants we were needed for a special duty. What duty? I asked, guiding her inside, away from curious ears. They're moving the saint, she whispered. Her actual remains. They've never been moved, not in 8,000 years. It's forbidden. But the Cardinal said she must be protected from what's coming. That night, we heard screaming from the underhive levels beneath us. The Arbites were going door to door, confiscating food supplies. For equitable redistribution, they claimed. But we knew better. The supplies were going up spire, not down. On the third day, the Vox networks began to fail. First the entertainment channels, then the news, until only the emergency broadcast system remained functional. The governor's voice, clearly recorded earlier, played on a continuous loop. Citizens of Velsis remain calm and faithful. The current supply disruption is temporary. Rationing protocols are being implemented for your protection. The ecclesiarchy is working tirelessly to re-establish contact with the wider imperium. The God-Emperor protects. but the god emperor seemed very far away and his protection increasingly doubtful i reported to the docks as usual only to find the orbital elevators shut down hundreds of workers milled about in confusion an arbytes officer addressed us through a vox hailer By order of Governor Vulture, all orbital operations are temporarily suspended. Workers are to return to their HAB blocks and await further instructions. Compliance is mandatory. Resistance will be met with lethal force. Someone in the crowd shouted a question about pay. The Arbites officer raised his shotgun and silence fell immediately. As we dispersed, I found myself walking beside Carrick. The overseer looked older somehow, the lines in his face deeper than they had been just days ago. What's happening? I asked him quietly. Carrick's augmatic eye word, focusing somewhere in the middle distance. I served in the guard before my injury, he said. Saw three campaigns against the arch-enemy. This feels the same. The quiet before the slaughter begins. But there's no enemy here, I said. Karak looked at me, and for the first time, I saw genuine fear in his human eye. There's always an enemy, Malrek. Sometimes it's just waiting for the right moment to show itself. He clasped my shoulder briefly, then turned down a side street, disappearing into the crowd. It was the last time I ever saw him. When I reached the mid-spire, I found the situation deteriorating rapidly. A crowd had gathered outside a food distribution center, their voices rising in anger as an Arbite's detachment kept them at bay. The ration cards issued the previous day were being declared invalid, replaced with a new system that provided even smaller allocations. I skirted the edge of the crowd, keeping my head down. Violence felt imminent, hanging in the air like the smell before a storm. As I moved through the back alleys, taking a longer route to avoid the main thoroughfares, I saw something that made my blood run cold. A child stood in an empty courtyard, her back to me. She was perhaps seven or eight years old, wearing the plain gray uniform of a mid-spire scolum. She was perfectly still, staring up at the sky. I followed her gaze and saw nothing unusual, just the perpetual amber smog that hung over Vel Primaris. But as I watched, the child raised her hand, pointing, The angels are falling, she said, her voice eerily calm. Look, they're falling and burning. There was nothing there, nothing visible to my eyes, but the certainty in her voice made me shudder. I hurried past, not looking back. When I reached my Hab block, I found the entrance guarded by two men I recognized from neighboring units. They carried makeshift weapons, a pipe wrench and a kitchen knife. They nodded to me, allowing me to pass. Inside, the residents had organized. Someone had broken into the building's maintenance room and diverted emergency power to our block, ensuring we had light and heat while other areas went dark. Linia was there, but something was wrong. She sat on our bed, rocking slightly, her eyes unfocused. The reliquary is empty, she said when I touched her shoulder. Eight thousand years of history. Gone. They took everything that could be moved. The Cardinal left with an escort of ecclesiarchy guards. They're abandoning the basilica. Where did they go? I asked, though I already suspected the answer. Upspire! To the Governor's Palace. She looked at me, suddenly present again. Jorun, before he left, Cardinal Mox addressed the attendants. He said we were in the time of testing. He said the Emperor has turned his face from humanity to see who remains faithful when his light is gone. I sat beside her, taking her cold hands in mine. It's just warp storms, I said, trying to sound more confident than I felt. They'll pass. The ships will come again. Linear shook her head. The astropaths are dead, Jorun, all of them. They killed themselves yesterday, every single one. They clawed out their eyes and threw themselves from the telepathic aspire. I had no response to that. The astropaths were our link to the wider imperium, their psychic abilities allowing communication across the vast gulfs of space. Without them, we were truly alone. That night, we heard the first gunshots from the Underhive. The sound was distant but unmistakable. Nobody went to investigate. On the fourth day, the pretense of normalcy collapsed entirely. The Vox network broadcast only static. The Arbites retreated to the upper spires, abandoning the mid and lower levels to their fate. In their absence, gangs quickly formed, fighting over the remaining resources. Old rivalries between Habb blocks, between work crews, between families suddenly had lethal stakes. I ventured out only once, joining a group of men from my block who planned to scavenge supplies from an abandoned merchantry. The streets had transformed overnight. Barricades of furniture and debris blocked major intersections. Bodies lay in doorways, some killed by violence, others simply dead from despair. The air smelled of smoke and rot. Our scavenging mission was a partial success. The merchantry had been picked over, but we found a cache of preserved food hidden beneath the floorboards. As we packed our findings, I heard a sound that made us all freeze, the deep, resonant toll of the basilica's great bell. It had not rung since the sky broke. We hurried to finish our task, each toll of the bell increasing our anxiety. By the time we began our return journey, the sound had drawn others from their shelters. The streets filled with people moving toward the basilica, their faces showing a mixture of hope and fear. Had help arrived? Was the ecclesiarchy returning? I followed at a distance, curiosity overcoming caution. The great doors of the basilica stood open for the first time in days. People streamed inside, and with every passing minute, the crowd grew. I found a side entrance, one linear had shown me years ago, used by the attendants. It led to a narrow gallery that overlooked the main nave. From this vantage point, I saw thousands of citizens packed into the basilica. The great space, designed to inspire awe with its soaring arches and golden iconography, now felt oppressive. Most of the gold was gone, removed by the Cardinal's orders. The absence of the relics left obvious gaps, like missing teeth in a forced smile. At the far end, where St. Drusilla's remains had once been displayed, stood a man I did not recognize. He wore the robes of an ecclesiarchy priest, but not the ornate vestments of a ranking member. His attire was simple, almost ascetic. When he spoke, his voice carried clearly through the vast space without the aid of Vox amplification. The cardinal has abandoned you, he began, causing a ripple of murmurs through the crowd. The governor prepares to flee. The Arbites protect only the wealthy, but I am still here. I remain with you, the faithful, the forgotten. He raised his arms, and I noticed they were covered in fresh scars, self-inflicted wounds that spelled out prayers in flowing script. I am Father Thade, once a simple minister to the Underhive parishes. The Emperor has spoken to me in visions. He has revealed the truth of our situation. The crowd grew still, hungry for any explanation, any guidance. The great rift that has cut us off from the Emperor's light is no accident, no mere cosmic phenomenon. It is a test, a purification. Thade's voice grew more intense. Those who abandoned us, who hoarded resources, who fled to their spires, they have already failed this test. But we, the faithful who remain, we have the opportunity to prove ourselves worthy. A sense of unease crept through me as I listened, Thade spoke with absolute conviction, and the desperate crowd clung to his every word. The emperor's light will return to those who demonstrate true faith. Not through empty rituals and golden statues, but through blood and sacrifice. A woman near the front called out, What must we do, father? Thade's face transformed with a terrible smile. We must cleanse Velsis of the unfaithful. We must tear down the spires where the wealthy hide. We must offer up the non-believers as sacrifice. Their blood will rekindle the emperor's light. The basilica erupted in sound, some crying out in support, others in horror. I backed, away from the gallery railing, suddenly afraid to be seen. What I had witnessed was the birth of something dangerous, a twisted faith born of desperation and abandonment. I made my way back to my Habblock as quickly as possible, avoiding the main streets where Thade's followers were already spreading his message. By the time I reached home, the first fires were visible in the distance, black smoke rising from the commercial district. Linear listened in silence as I recounted what I had seen. When I finished, she went to a small drawer beside our bed and removed a bundle wrapped in cloth. One of the senior attendants gave this to me before she left with the cardinal, she said, unwrapping the package to reveal a small silver medallion. It depicted Saint Drusilla, her face serene in death. She said it was actually touched to the saint's remains. She said it would protect me. I didn't believe in such things, not really. The emperor was distant, the saint's mere propaganda tools of the ecclesiarchy. But I said nothing as Linnea hung the medallion around her neck. Faith was in short supply, and if this small token gave her comfort, I wouldn't take it from her. That night, we couldn't sleep. The sounds of the city's unraveling were too loud, too close. Gunshots, screams, the crackle of spreading fires. Occasionally, we heard chanting, the words indistinct but the fervor unmistakable. Thade's disciples were on the move. We sat together in darkness, conserving the power cells for our lumen globe. Linia leaned against me, her body tense, ready to flee at a moment's notice. We had packed small bags with essentials. Where we would go, I didn't know. Every direction seemed to offer only different forms of death. Do you remember when we first met? Linear asked suddenly, her voice soft in the darkness. I did remember. It had been at a mid-spire festival, celebrating the founding of Vel Primaris. There had been music, rare fruits imported at great expense, even a display of controlled fireworks. Linnea had been newly assigned to the basilica then, proud of her position. I had been struck by her serious demeanor, the careful way she spoke, as if weighing each word for its worth before releasing it. "'You were wearing blue,' I said. A shade I'd never seen before. Ultra-marine, she replied. Imported from Macrage itself, according to the merchant. Probably a lie, but I believed it then. I was so naive. We sat in silence for a moment, remembering a time that suddenly seemed centuries distant rather than mere years. I've been thinking, Linnea continued. About what's happening, about why. I waited, sensing she needed to articulate something important. The priests always taught us that faith would protect us. That devotion to the emperor would shield us from harm. Her voice hardened slightly. But look around, Jorun. The most devout are suffering alongside everyone else. The cardinal fled. The relics couldn't save us. Such words were dangerous, bordering on heresy. But who remained to punish heresy now? Perhaps this is why, she whispered. Perhaps we're being punished for building our faith on lies, for allowing the powerful to use the emperor's name to control us, for accepting our place without question, I had no answer for her. The theology of our situation was beyond my understanding. I was a practical man, concerned with survival, not the reasons behind our abandonment. Before dawn we heard heavy footsteps on the stairs. Our neighbors had established a watch rotation and the current watchman pounded on our door. Vade's followers. He hissed when I opened it. They're coming through the sector, building by building. They're looking for something, or someone. I thanked him and closed the door. Linea was already dousing our few candles, plunging the Hab unit into complete darkness. We huddled in the corner furthest from the door, barely breathing. The footsteps grew louder, accompanied by voices calling out Thade's twisted, litany. Blood reveals the faithful. Sacrifice returns the light. The Emperor's face turns to those who offer up the impure. They passed our door without stopping. Perhaps they found what they sought elsewhere in the building. Perhaps we were simply fortunate. Either way, when the sounds faded, we remained frozen in place for hours, afraid the slightest movement would betray our presence. When we finally dared to move again, I went to the window. The basilica, once the proud center of our city, was transformed. Great fires burned within, visible through the shattered stained glass. The statue of Saint Drusilla that had stood in the courtyard was toppled, her stone face now staring sightlessly at the ground. And above it all, the sky continued to burn with unnatural light, a constant reminder that the universe itself had changed, The Great Rift, they were calling it now. A wound in reality that might never heal. Five days after the sky broke, Vel Primaris was no longer recognizable as an imperial city. The upper spires remained locked and guarded, islands of relative stability in a sea of chaos. The mid-spire, where we lived, had fragmented into territories controlled by various factions. Some rallied around Father Thade and his blood cult, others formed defense groups based on occupation or origin. Former guardsmen organized one sector into a military-style compound. Merchant families barricaded entire blocks. The underhive had gone silent. No one came up, and no one dared go down. Rumors spread that something had awakened in those dark depths, something that had always been there, waiting for the Emperor's light to dim. Linear and I made a decision. We couldn't stay in our HAB unit. Thade's followers were growing bolder, and it was only a matter of time before they returned. We needed to find a safer haven, somewhere to wait out the madness. I suggested joining one of the defense groups, but Linear was hesitant. They're all just different kinds of desperation," she said. Different justifications for the same violence. In the end, we chose to head for the docks. The orbital elevators were shut down, but the vast warehouses and maintenance bays offered countless hiding places. Few would venture there now that no ships were arriving. It might provide temporary sanctuary while we determined our next move, We left at first light, carrying only what we could fit in our small packs. The journey that normally took me less than an hour to walk stretched into a day-long ordeal of careful navigation through contested streets. We avoided main thoroughfares, keeping to service alleys and maintenance tunnels that I knew from years of transporting cargo. The city had transformed into a war zone. Barricades made of overturned ground cars and debris blocked many routes. Bodies lay where they had fallen. some fresh, others beginning to decay in the unusually warm air. The smell was overwhelming at times, forcing us to cover our faces with cloth dampened from our precious water supplies. Twice we hid from passing groups. Once it was Thade's cultists, identifiable by the self-inflicted wounds on their exposed skin, imitating their leader's scarification rituals. The second group wore the uniforms of dock workers, but moved with military precision, clearly searching for something or someone. By late afternoon, we reached the outskirts of the dock complex. The massive structure loomed against the burning sky, its upper reaches lost in smog and unnatural clouds. The main entrance was blocked by a makeshift barrier, but no guards were visible. Still, we circled around, seeking a less obvious point of entry. We found it in a drainage tunnel, designed to channel rainwater away from the landing pads. The tunnel was narrow and foul-smelling, but navigable. We crawled through darkness for what felt like hours, guided only by my vague memories of the dock's layout and Linear's small glow globe, its power carefully rationed. When we finally emerged, we found ourselves in a deserted maintenance bay. Tools lay scattered across workbenches, abandoned mid-task when the order to evacuate came. A half-disassembled servitor hung from a repair rig, its organic components decaying while its mechanical parts remained pristine. We should find somewhere more secure, I whispered, though there was no one to hear us. The habit of caution was already deeply ingrained after less than a week of chaos. We moved deeper into the complex, passing through workshops and storage areas. Most had been stripped of anything useful, but occasionally we found overlooked supplies, a forgotten ration pack, a hand-lamp with a half-charged power cell, small treasures in our new reality. Eventually, we discovered an administrative office tucked between two larger warehouses. It was small but defensible, with only one entrance and no windows. best of all it had an independent power supply a small generator meant to ensure critical systems remained operational during outages this will do linear said setting down her pack with a wince her shoulders were raw from the straps digging into flesh that was already growing thin from reduced rations I activated the generator, keeping it at its lowest setting to minimize noise and conserve fuel. The office's lumen strips cast a weak yellow glow, barely enough to see by, but it was the first artificial light we'd had in days. As Linear organized our meager supplies, I examined a Vox unit built into the office wall. It was an older model, designed for short-range communication within the dock complex. On impulse, I switched it on, keeping the volume low. Static filled the small room immediately. I adjusted the frequency, scanning through channels that once would have been busy with the routine communications of a functioning starport. Now there was only electronic snow, the empty hiss of a void where human voices should have been. Then, as I was about to give up, a voice cut through the static. It, was distorted, fading in and out, but unmistakably human. Repeat. This is orbital platform Drusilla's light to any Imperial forces groundside. We are cut off. The Mandeville Point Island. Something coming through. Not Imperial. Request immediate. Emperor protect us. The transmission dissolved back into static. I frantically adjusted the controls, trying to re-establish contact, but the voice did not return. Linia stood beside me, her face pale in the dim light. There are still people up there," she said. On the orbital platforms, I nodded slowly. The orbital platforms were essentially small space stations, waypoints between the surface and the void beyond. They housed customs officials, administratum clerks, tech priests who maintained the great ship's systems during port calls. When the elevators shut down, these people would have been stranded, And something's coming. I added, my mouth suddenly dry. Something not imperial. We didn't speak further on the matter. What could we say? If hostile forces were entering the system, we had no defenses, no weapons that could touch vessels in the void. We were as helpless as insects before a boot. That night, we slept in shifts. The office had a small couch, presumably for administrators working late. It was more comfortable than anything we'd slept on since the crisis began. Linear took the first rest while I kept watch, listening to the Vox unit on the lowest audible volume, hoping for more transmissions. None came. Instead, distant sounds echoed through the vast dock complex. Metallic clangs, footsteps. Once, something that might have been a scream or might have been machinery settling. It was impossible to tell. When it was my turn to sleep, I dreamed of the sky breaking open wider, a vast moor swallowing Velsis hole. I woke with a start to find Linear shaking me gently. Someone's coming, she whispered. I heard voices. We quickly gathered our belongings, ready to flee if necessary. I switched off the generator, plunging the office into darkness. We positioned ourselves on either side of the door, listening intently. The voices grew closer. Two people, perhaps three, moving with no attempt at stealth. Their footsteps echoed on the metal decking outside our hiding place. The fuel reserves should be in the next section, a male voice said. Enough Prometheum to power the Generatorum for months, if we can transport it. If the governor hasn't already claimed it, a second voice replied, female and vaguely familiar. The governor's people took what they could carry, not what they couldn't, the first voice said. They're preparing for void travel, not a siege. The footsteps paused just outside our door. I held my breath, feeling linear do the same beside me. This office might have schematics, the female voice said. Worth checking. The door slid open, flooding the space with light from hand lamps. I raised my arm to shield my eyes, momentarily blinded after the complete darkness. Throne of terror, the woman exclaimed. Malrek, is that you? As my vision adjusted, I recognized the speaker. Hale Avinch, head of maintenance for the orbital elevators. I had worked with her occasionally when Doc Cruz were assigned to elevator repairs. Vinch, I said, lowering my arm slowly. you're alive she snorted an incongruously normal sound in our abnormal situation obviously you too it seems and who's this my wife linia i said linia nodded cautiously her hand still gripping a metal rod she had seized as a makeshift weapon the man with hala stepped into view He was tall and gaunt, with the distinctive implants of a low-ranking tech priest visible at his temples and throat. Enginsir Drav. He introduced himself with a slight bow. We are attempting to restore limited function to the elevators. I stared at them in confusion. Why? The orbital platforms are in danger. We heard a transmission. Hayela and Drave exchanged glances. What transmission? Hayela asked sharply. I recounted what we'd heard, the fragmented message suggesting hostile forces entering the system. As I spoke, the tech, priest's expression grew increasingly troubled, the augmatic components of his face whirring and clicking as they processed emotional data, his altered brain could no longer fully comprehend. This confirms the astropathic death screams, he said when I finished. The immaterium has changed. The walls between realities have thinned. What was contained can now enter. Speak plainly, Drave, Hella snapped. These aren't your tech brothers. The Enginsier inclined his head in acknowledgement. Apologies. I believe warp entities are manifesting in real space. Daemons, to use the common vernacular. The transmission you heard suggests they are able to navigate the Great Rift where imperial ships cannot. I felt a chill run through me. Everyone knew of the arch-enemy, the corrupting forces of chaos. But such threats were distant, handled by space marines and Imperial Guard regiments, not something that concerned ordinary citizens of a minor shrine world. What can we do? Linea asked, her voice small but steady. Join us, Heila said immediately. We're gathering skilled workers, people who can be useful. The governor and her entourage will flee, but some of us are staying to fight." "'Fight daemons?' I asked incredulously. "'With what? Maintenance tools?' Hyala's face hardened. "'With whatever we have. The alternative is to die cowering in the dark, or to join lunatics like Thade and his blood cult. I looked at Linnea, seeing my own fear and uncertainty reflected in her eyes. But there was something else there, too. Determination. She had lost her faith in the institutions of the Imperium, but not in humanity itself. We'll help, she said before I could speak. What do you need us to do? Heila smiled grimly. First, we restore power to key systems, then we establish a defensive perimeter. Drave believes certain machine rights can strengthen the barriers between dimensions, at least locally, and then, Then we survive. The tech priest finished. For as long as possible. It wasn't much of a plan. It offered little real hope. But it was something to do besides wait for death. And in that moment, that was enough. We joined Heiler and Draves' group, which had established a base in one of the larger maintenance bays. About 20 people had gathered there, a mixture of dock workers, tech adepts, and even a few administratum clerks who had been stranded when the elevators shut down. They had organized themselves with surprising efficiency, allocating tasks based on skills and establishing watch rotations. Over the next two days, we worked to secure our position. The dock complex was vast, impossible to defend in its entirety. Instead, we focused on a central section that included critical systems, living quarters, and access to water recycling facilities. Barricades were constructed at key access points. Alarm systems were rigged from repurposed maintenance equipment. Linnea, with her experience handling delicate relics, was assigned to assist Drave with what he called dimensional stabilization rituals. I didn't understand the complex machine cant he chanted while arranging mysterious devices salvaged from the tech priest's quarters, but Linnea approached the task with the same careful attention she had once given to St. Drusilla's remains. I worked with Heila, restoring power to essential systems and rigging the emergency Vox network to scan for transmissions. We heard nothing more from the orbital platforms. The silence was more terrifying than any distress call would have been. On the eighth day after the sky broke, the first of Thade's followers found the docks. They came in small groups at first, searching for supplies or converts. Our sentries spotted them easily, their ritual scars visible even at a distance. We avoided confrontation where possible, staying hidden, letting them take. What little they found in the outer areas. But as their numbers increased, conflict became inevitable. On the tenth day, they discovered one of our scavenging parties. Only one of our people returned, bleeding from multiple wounds, delirious with pain and terror. They took Merrick and Falson alive. He gasped as our medic. A former medicay servitor overseer named Thelis treated his injuries. Said they needed pure blood for the ritual. said the Emperor demanded sacrifice. We doubled our watches after that, arming ourselves with whatever could be fashioned into weapons. Dock tools became spears and clubs. Hale showed us how to create simple traps using pressure plates and falling debris. Drave consecrated our makeshift armaments with unguents and binary prayers, for whatever good that might do against human madness, let alone demonic incursion. That night, I stood watch with a dockhand named Corvell, a taciturn man who had lost his entire family when Thade's followers burned their Hab block. We were positioned at the southern barricade, a choke point where three corridors converged into a single cargo bay. The air was cold, unusually so for Velsis, and our breath fogged before us. You hear that?" Corvelle whispered suddenly. I listened intently. At first, there was only the ambient hum of the few functioning systems, the occasional groan of the vast structure settling. Then I caught it, a sound like distant singing, multiple voices chanting in unison. The words were indistinct, but the cadence was unmistakable, rising and falling in the familiar patterns of imperial hymns twisted into something profane. They're coming. I said, activating the crude alarm system Hayala had devised. A series of metal plates that would clang together when a chord was pulled. The sound echoed through our section of the docks, rousing our companions from sleep. Within minutes, our entire group was mobilized, taking predetermined defensive positions. The singing grew louder, echoing strangely through the metal corridors. And then they appeared, filing into the cargo bay from all three corridors simultaneously. There were dozens of them, far more than our scouts had reported. Men and women of all ages, from all levels of Vel Primaris society, now unified in their devotion to Thade's bloody creed. They carried torches and crude weapons. Their faces and arms were marked with fresh scarification, prayers and symbols carved into flesh. At their center walked a figure I recognized with a jolt of horror, Father Thade himself. His robes now dyed crimson with what could only be blood. They halted just beyond the range of our traps, forming a loose semicircle. Thade stepped forward, his eyes scanning our barricade until they found Haella, who stood at the center of our line. Children of the Emperor. He called, his voice carrying that same unnatural resonance I had heard in the basilica. Why do you hide in darkness when the light of salvation is offered freely? We want no part of your salvation, Thadeh, Hala replied, her voice steady despite the obvious disparity in our numbers. Leave us in peace or we'll show you a different kind of light. Thadeh smiled, a gentle expression utterly at odds with the madness in his eyes. Peace? There can be no peace in abandonment. Only through sacrifice can we regain the Emperor's favor. Only through blood can we rekindle his light. As he spoke, I noticed something disturbing. The air around Thade seemed to shimmer, like heat rising from a forge. His shadow, cast by the torchlight, did not quite match his movements, always a fraction of a second behind or ahead. The ritual requires pure blood, Thade continued. The blood of those who still cling to the old ways, who refuse to embrace the new truth. Your sacrifice will save countless others. We're not sacrificing anyone, Hayila said, raising the shock mall she had claimed from an abandoned Arbite's equipment locker, especially not to feed your ends of Nand. Delusions. Thade sighed, as if genuinely disappointed. Then you leave us no choice." He raised his hands, now revealed to be covered in intricate scars that formed complex patterns across his skin. In the Emperor's name, let blood flow, let flesh be rendered, let souls be freed to fuel his return. At his command, his followers surged forward. Our traps claimed the first wave, dropping heavy cargo containers onto the unprotected zealots, impaling others on concealed metal spikes. But they kept coming. Climbing over their fallen comrades without hesitation, their faces transfixed in ecstatic devotion. The battle was chaos. I fought beside Corvell, wielding a length of pipe with a sharpened end. My dock-worker's strength served me well, allowing me to keep the cultists at bay with sweeping blows. But for every one that fell, two more took their place. Corvell went down beside me, a makeshift blade buried in his throat. I couldn't spare even a moment to acknowledge his death, too busy defending myself from three attackers, a woman in the tattered remains of an administratum uniform, a man who might once have been a fellow dock worker, a child no older than twelve, eyes blazing with fanatical light. I struck the child with the blunt end of my weapon, unwilling to kill someone so young despite the knife in their small hand. The moment of hesitation nearly cost me my life as the woman slashed at my face with a jagged piece of metal. I felt the sting as it opened my cheek, warm blood spilling down my neck. The fighting was intense but brief. We were outnumbered four to one. Our defenses, hastily assembled from available materials, could not withstand the sheer weight of bodies thrown against them. One by one, our people fell or retreated, the line buckling then breaking entirely. Fall back to secondary positions," Heila shouted over the din. Controlled withdrawal. Move! I backed away, still facing the oncoming cultists, searching desperately for Linnea in the chaos. I spotted her near Drave, the two of them activating some device that emitted a high-pitched wine. As it reached its crescendo, a shockwave pulsed outward, throwing the nearest cultists backward. The tech, priests' dimensional stabilization ritual had some effect after all, though whether it was truly warp science or simply clever use of sonic technology i couldn't say either way it brought us precious seconds to retreat to our fallback position a narrower corridor where our reduced numbers would be less of a disadvantage we regrouped quickly counting our losses Five dead, including Corvall. Three wounded, severely enough to hamper their fighting ability. The rest of us were bloodied but functional. Linea appeared at my side, pressing a cloth to the cut on my cheek. It's not deep, she said, her voice clinical, detached. I recognized the tone. It was how she spoke when cataloguing damaged relics, assessing what could be saved and what was beyond repair." Before I could respond, Thade's voice echoed down the corridor. You cannot escape the Emperor's judgment, he called. The blood tithe must be paid. The ritual must be completed before midnight. What happens at midnight? Drave murmured, more to himself than to us. His augmatic eye word as it focused on something none of us could see. The celestial alignment, the scissorgy of the inner planets, the thinning of the veil. Speak plainly, Drave. Haela snapped, echoing her earlier admonishment but with greater urgency. The tech, priest's organic eye focused on her with difficulty. The warp incursion risk peaks at midnight. If Thade's rituals are what I suspect, he is attempting to open a deliberate breach in reality. A doorway. A doorway for what? I asked, though I feared I knew the answer. For whatever waits on the other side, Drave replied, For the entities that feed on faith and fear and blood, Heila cursed, a string of void sailor profanity that would have shocked me a week earlier. Now it seemed entirely appropriate. We can't let that happen, she said finally. Whatever it takes, Thade cannot complete his ritual. There are too many of them, Linear said, her voice quiet but firm. And we're trapped here. They control all the exits. A heavy silence fell over our group as the reality of our situation sank in. We were cornered, outnumbered, with limited supplies and no way to call for help. Even if we could somehow defeat Thade's cultists, the planet itself was still cut off from the wider Imperium, still vulnerable to whatever forces were gathering in the void above. It was Drave who broke the silence, his voice taking on the emotionless cadence of pure machine logic. There is one option we have not considered, he said. The orbital elevators. They're shut down, Heila reminded him. And even if we could restart them, where would we go? The platforms are under attack. Not up, Drave said, down, to the engine levels. The primary generators for the elevator system are there, connected directly to the geothermal taps that power much of Vel Primaris. I began to understand his thinking. If we overload those generators... We could destroy this entire complex, Drave confirmed. And anyone within it, including ourselves, Linnea added softly. The tech priest inclined his head in acknowledgement. The Omnisiah teaches that all machines eventually cease function. The same is true of our biological components. The only variables are time and utility. It was, in its way, a deeply pragmatic philosophy. If we were to die regardless, did it not make sense to ensure our deaths served some purpose? to deny Thade his ritual, to prevent whatever horror he sought to unleash upon our already suffering world. Haile looked at each of us in turn, reading our faces. Some showed fear, others resignation. A few, like Drave, displayed grim determination. When her gaze met mine, I gave her a small nod, better a clean death of our choosing than whatever fate Thade had planned. The engine levels, she said finally. How do we reach them without using the main corridors?" Dreyve produced a data slate from within his robes, maintenance ducts, restricted access. My authorization should still function. We gathered what supplies we could carry, distributed the remaining weapons, and prepared to move. The sounds of Thade's followers echoed from the corridor. Their chanting growing more frenzied as midnight approached. As our group filed into the narrow maintenance duct that Drave had opened, I found myself next to Linnea. She clutched St. Drusilla's medallion in one hand, her knuckles white with tension. "'Are you praying?' I asked quietly. She considered the question for a moment. "'Not to the Emperor,' she said finally. "'Not anymore, but to something, to whatever might be listening. I understood.' Faith, like hope, was difficult to abandon entirely, even when its foundations crumbled. We needed to believe in something larger than ourselves, something that gave meaning to our suffering and purpose to our deaths. The journey through the maintenance ducts was arduous. We crawled through spaces designed for servitors, not full-sized humans. The air was stale and thin, tainted with the smell of machine oil and decay. Twice we had to stop when members of our group suffered panic attacks in the confined space. Each time, we waited silently, aware that any noise might betray our position to the cultists searching the corridors above. After what felt like hours, Drave led us to a vertical shaft that descended into darkness. A narrow metal ladder ran along one wall, disappearing into the blackness below. The primary engine levels... The tech priest announced, 117 meters down. We descended in single file, our hand lamps casting weak circles of light that barely penetrated the oppressive dark. The further we went, the warmer the air became, heavy with the smell of ozone and hot metal. The distant rumble of massive machinery grew steadily louder, felt as much as heard, a vibration that rattled teeth and bones." when we finally reached the bottom we emerged into a vast chamber that seemed to extend for kilometers in every direction enormous generators stood like cathedral spires their surfaces covered in warning runes and mechanica's sigils pipes as thick as a man's torso ran between them carrying coolant and power and data Servitors moved along predetermined paths, performing maintenance tasks with mindless efficiency, unaware that the world above was collapsing into madness. Drave approached a central control dais, his hands moving across the ancient cogitator interfaces with practiced familiarity. Glowing hololithic displays sputtered to life, showing schematics and power flow diagrams too complex for my untrained eye to interpret. The system was designed with failsafe's. Dreyv explained as he worked. To prevent exactly what we are attempting, I will need time to bypass them. How much time? Hialeah asked, organizing our remaining fighters into a defensive perimeter around the dais. Thirty minutes. Perhaps more. The tech priest did not look up from his task. Less, if I had a full complement of tech adepts, as it stands, I must perform the rites alone. I checked my chronometer, twenty-three minutes until midnight, until whatever celestial alignment Tade was waiting for reached its peak. "'Will Thade know we're here?' I asked. "'Will he follow us?' "'Almost certainly,' Dreyve replied. "'The power fluctuations caused by my overrides will register on any functioning awespex. "'If his followers include anyone with technical knowledge, "'they will recognize what we are attempting.' I exchanged glances with Linnea. "'Neither of us needed to speak the obvious. "'We were in a race against time, and the stakes were unimaginably high.' Haile organized us efficiently, positioning fighters at each entrance to the vast chamber, establishing fields of fire with our limited range weapons, preparing fallback positions. It was clear she had military experience beyond what would be expected of a dock maintenance chief. In another life, I might have asked about her past. Now it seemed irrelevant. We were defined not by where we had come from, but by what we chose to do in these final hours. Linear and I were assigned to the northern entrance, a massive blast door that had been left partially open to allow servitor access. We took cover behind a coolant exchange unit, improvised weapons at the ready. My pipe spear had served me well in the earlier fight. Linnea carried a shock baton taken from a fallen Arbites officer, its power cell nearly depleted, but still capable of delivering a disabling charge if used sparingly. If we succeed, she said quietly as we settled into position, what happens to the rest of the city? To everyone else on Velsis? I hadn't considered the broader implications. Our plan would destroy the dock complex and anyone within it, including ourselves and Thade's cultists. But what of the millions of other citizens scattered across Vel Primaris and beyond? Would denying Thade his ritual be enough to save them from whatever fate awaited our abandoned world? I don't know, I admitted. But it's the only option we have. Linear nodded, accepting this truth with the same quiet strength she had shown throughout the crisis. I'm glad we're together, she said. At the end, I reached for her hand, clasping it briefly before returning to my vigilant watch. There was nothing more to say. Whatever came next, we would face it side by side. The attack, when it came, was not from Thardae's cultists, but from something far worse. It began with the servitors. The mindless cyborgs suddenly stopped their tasks, standing motionless for several seconds. Then, as one, they turned toward us. Their augmatic eyes glowed with an unnatural light, no longer the dull red of Mechanicus' implants, but a sickly purple that seemed to bleed into the air around. Throne of terror, I whispered as the nearest servitor lurched toward our position, its movements jerky but purposeful. The machine spirits are corrupted, Drave's voice called from the central dais, tense with an emotion I had never heard from the tech priest before. Fear. Some external force is overriding the command protocols. The servitors attacked in unison, abandoning their tools and maintenance implements to assault us with mechanical hands and implanted weaponry meant for industrial tasks. What they lacked in combat programming they made up for in sheer numbers and in human strength. Our group fought desperately, not just for survival but for the precious minutes Drave needed to complete his work. Hiella directed our defense, repositioning fighters as the Servitor Assault intensified. We destroyed dozens of the cyborgs, but more kept coming, crawling from maintenance shafts and emerging from dormant alcoves built into the chamber walls. And then we heard it. Chanting, echoing from all directions at once, Thade's followers had found us. They poured into the chamber from multiple entrances, moving with the same jerky, puppet-like motion as the corrupted servitors. Their eyes glowed with the same purple light. Their self-inflicted wounds now leaked a substance that was not quite blood, too thick and dark, almost black in the dim lighting of the engine level. At their center walked Thade himself, but he was transformed. His body seemed larger somehow, his proportions subtly wrong, as if something wore his skin like an ill-fitting garment. His shadow writhed independently of his movements, forming shapes that hurt the eye to observe directly. The doorway opens, he called, his voice layered with other voices, a chorus of madness that set my teeth on edge. The faithful will be elevated, the doubtful will be consumed. All will serve the glory that comes. Ten more minutes! Drave shouted from the dais, his hands blurring across the controls. Defend. The position at all costs. Hale rallied our dwindling group. Form a circle around the dais. Hold them off. For Velsis. For humanity. It was a desperate last stand. We fought back to back, cultists and corrupted servitors pressing in from all sides. I lost track of time, lost track of how many enemies fell to my makeshift spear. My arms burned with fatigue. Blood, both mine and others, made my grip slippery. Beside me, Linnea fought with surprising effectiveness, her smaller stature allowing her to target vulnerable points that larger opponents left exposed. Through the chaos of battle, I caught glimpses of Thade. He was not fighting. Instead, he stood at the edge of the melee, arms raised, continuing his chant, The air around him rippled and tore, revealing brief flashes of something beyond, something that should not exist in real space. Tendrils of energy, the same sickly purple as the glow in his followers' eyes, reached through these momentary rifts, caressing the nearest cultists. Where they touched, flesh bubbled and transformed, mutating into new and horrific forms. The machine spirits fight me, Drave called, his voice strained. Something is attempting to seize control of the generators. I cannot hold it off and complete the overload sequence simultaneously. Haile, bleeding from multiple wounds but still standing, made a split-second decision. Thelis, Merrick, with me, will protect Drave. Everyone else fall back to the secondary position. I recognize the strategy. Our numbers were too few to hold the entire perimeter. By concentrating our defense directly around Dreyve and the Control Dias, we might buy him the time he needed. Linia and I retreated as ordered, joining the handful of survivors at a defensible choke point 20 meters back. From this position, I could still see the Control Dias and the desperate struggle taking place there. Haile and her chosen fighters formed a living barrier around Drav, intercepting cultists and servitors that broke through the outer defenses. And then I saw something that turned my blood to ice. A tendril of purple energy, thicker and more substantial than the others, snaked directly toward the control dais. It moved with purpose, ignoring the cultists in its path, focused entirely on Drav and the generator controls. Warp breach imminent. The tech priest shouted, his voice cutting through the din of battle. The barriers between dimensions are collapsing. We have minutes, not hours. The tendril reached the edge of the dais. Haella saw it and interposed herself. Shockmal raised. The energy touched her weapon, causing it to spark and fail immediately. Then it touched her. I will never forget the sound she made. Not a scream, but a chord, as if multiple voices emerged from her throat simultaneously. Her body arched backward, suspended in the air by the unnatural energy. Before our eyes, her form began to change, flesh flowing like wax, bones cracking, and reforming into impossible configurations. Drave did not hesitate. He drew a small pistol from within his robes, a device I recognized as a Mechanicus pattern plasma weapon typically used for precision welding rather than combat. Without a word, he fired once, directly into Heia's transforming body. The plasma bolt struck true, vaporizing most of her torso instantly. What remained fell to the floor in chunks of meat that continued to writhe and change for several seconds before finally going still. The tendril of energy, momentarily disrupted, began to reform almost immediately. It is done, Drave announced, his organic eye fixed on the horror before him, while his augmentic components continued to interface with the control systems. The overload sequence is initiated. Four minutes until critical failure. Four minutes, 240 seconds until the generators exploded, taking the dock complex, Thade's cult, and ourselves with it. Until whatever doorway was opening between dimensions was slammed shut by the purifying force of plasma fire and conventional destruction, Thade must have sensed what was happening. His chanting rose to a fever pitch, the words no longer recognizable as Gothic or any human language. The rifts around him widened, revealing glimpses of a realm of madness beyond. More tendrils emerged, reaching for the control deus, for Drave, for the generator systems, The tech priest stood his ground, alternating between firing his small plasma weapon at the encroaching tendrils and making final adjustments to the overload sequence. The few remaining fighters around him fell one by one, their bodies torn apart by cultists or claimed by the transforming touch of the warp entities. Three minutes, Drave called. The sequence is locked, it cannot be stopped now, even if the physical controls are destroyed. A tendril finally reached him, wrapping around his augmatic arm. Drave did not flinch. Instead, he triggered an emergency separation protocol, the limb detaching at the shoulder with a hiss of escaping pressure and a spray of sacred ungluence. The tech priest staggered but remained upright, continuing his defense of the control deus, even as the severed arm was dragged into one of the widening rifts. Linear clutched my arm, drawing my attention away from the horrific spectacle. We should go, she said urgently. Not to escape. That's impossible now, but to die on our own terms, not theirs. I understood immediately. Better to face the end in a quiet corner, together than to be torn apart by cultists or worse, transformed into something inhuman by the warp energies now flooding the chamber. We slipped away from the defensive position, unnoticed in the chaos. The cultists' attention was fixed entirely on the control dais and Drave's last stand. We found a small maintenance alcove, partially hidden behind a coolant pipe, and wedged ourselves inside. Sitting close together in that confined space, I was reminded of our first nights after the sky broke, huddled, in our HAB unit as the world fell apart around us. It seemed a lifetime ago, though barely two weeks had passed. Two minutes, I said, checking my chronometer. Do you regret coming with me to the docks? Linnea shook her head. We made a difference. A small one, perhaps, but real. If Thade's ritual is interrupted, who knows how many might be saved? I nodded, taking comfort in the thought. We hadn't simply survived. We had fought back against the darkness in our own limited way. It was more than most could claim in these final days of Velsis. Linia removed St. Drusilla's medallion from around her neck, studying it in the dim light filtering into our hiding place. I wonder if she knew, she said softly. When she came to Velsis 8,000 years ago, if she had some premonition of this moment, would it have changed anything if she did? I asked. Perhaps not, but it might have brought her comfort, knowing her presence here would inspire others to fight when the time came. She pressed the medallion into my hand. Keep this. Until the end. I accepted the token, not for any belief in its protective powers, but because it mattered to Linia. I slipped it into my pocket. feeling the weight of it against my thigh, solid and real in a world that was rapidly dissolving into nightmare. A sudden change in the ambient noise drew our attention. The sounds of fighting had diminished, replaced by a new tone, a resonant humming that seemed to vibrate through the very structure of the dock complex. The coolant pipes around us began to shake, rivets popping free under the strain. One minute, I said, though I no longer needed to check my chronometer. The increasing vibration of the generators told me all I needed to know. The overload was approaching critical mass. Linea and I held each other tightly as the world shook apart around us. The humming grew to a physical pressure against my eardrums, painful in its intensity. Metal groaned and bent. Concrete cracked. The laws, of physics themselves, seemed to be breaking down as the generators pushed beyond their design limitations. In those final seconds, I thought I glimpsed something through a crack in the wall of our alcove. Not the engine chamber with its corrupted servitors and transforming cultists, but somewhere else entirely. a realm of impossible colors and non-Euclidean geometry of entities too vast and alien for the human mind to comprehend. The Great Rift, the wound in reality that had started our descent into hell, now yawned wider as Thade's ritual and Drav's desperate countermeasure collided. then light, brighter than anything I had ever experienced, heat beyond imagining, pain, brief but absolute, and then nothing. Except, impossibly, there was something after nothing. I became aware gradually, in fragments, first sensation, cold, profound and penetrating, then sound, a rhythmic clicking, mechanical and precise. Finally, sight, darkness, punctuated by faint red lumens, casting more shadow than illumination. I was alive, or something like alive. I tried to move and found my body responded sluggishly, as if I were underwater or in a dream. My surroundings resolved slowly into recognizable shapes. Metal walls. Control panels with flickering runes. A view screen showing only static. The subject regains consciousness, a voice said flat and emotionless. Cognitive functions at 37% of baseline. Physical systems at 22%, recommended action, termination and resource reclamation. Another voice responded, this one vaguely familiar despite its mechanical distortion. Denied. The subject's testimony is invaluable. the experience of direct warp exposure without immediate corruption is a statistical anomaly worthy of further study. With enormous effort, I turned my head toward the voices. Two figures stood nearby, their forms obscured by hooded robes, red optical units glowed where eyes should have been, Mechanicus, tech priests of a higher rank than, Drave, their bodies more machine than human, their organic components reduced to the absolute minimum required for function. Where? My voice emerged as a rasp, barely audible. Where am I? Velsus Orbital Station Designation Gamma-9. The second tech priest replied, You were recovered from the wreckage of the planetary dock complex, approximately 73 hours after its destruction. Memories flooded back. The generators, the overload, the warp breach, Thade's ritual, linear. My wife, I managed to say, was anyone else. You were the only biological entity recovered with vital functions intact, the tech priest said. All others were either completely destroyed or corrupted beyond recognition. a coldness that had nothing to do with the ambient temperature spread through me. Linear was gone. Hala, Dreyv, all of them, gone. I had survived, alone. Why, I asked, the single word encompassing a universe of questions. The tech priest moved closer, mechanical limbs whirring, I could now see that what I had taken for a hood was actually part of their skull, a metal casing that housed additional augmatic components. You were found clutching this, they said, extending a mechadendrite that held a familiar object. St. Drusilla's medallion, the silver tarnished but otherwise intact. Analysis indicates the artifact possesses unique properties, a null-effect field approximately seven centimeters in radius. sufficient to shield a single human brain from warp influence during brief exposure. The medallion, Linnea's final gift to me. The relic that a senior basilica attendant had pressed into her hands before fleeing with the cardinal. It had actually protected me, not through faith or the emperor's blessing, but through some quirk of its physical composition. A scientific miracle rather than a divine one. The Great Rift, I said, forcing my mind to focus on larger concerns. Tade's ritual. Did we stop it? The dock complex was completely destroyed. The tech priest confirmed. The warp breach was sealed before it could fully manifest. The entity attempting to cross over was banished back to the immaterial. In this respect, your mission was successful. And Velsis? The city? The people? The people? The tech priest was silent for a moment, optical units adjusting as if recalibrating. Velprimeris has fallen. Approximately 63% of the population is deceased. 22% displays signs of warp corruption and must be purged. The remaining 15% have been evacuated to orbital platforms when transport became available. Transport? Hope flickered briefly. Ships came. The Adeptus Astartes arrived six days after the Astronomican disruption, the Tech Priest said. Chapter designation, Iron Hands. Their mission was asset retrieval and strategic denial, not civilian evacuation. However, they agreed to transport a limited number of survivors off-world, once critical Mechanicus personnel and equipment were secured. The Iron Hands, one of the Emperor's space marine chapters. They had come not to save us but to recover something valuable to the Imperium. The civilians rescued were an afterthought, a minor concession rather than the primary objective. What happens now? I asked. Too numb to feel anger at the calculated coldness of Imperial priorities. You will be transported to Mars for further study, the tech priest said. Your experience provides valuable data on warp exposure, survivability, and the properties of null-effect artifacts. You may yet serve the Omnisiah in ways you cannot comprehend. Mars The homeworld of the Mechanicus, tens of thousands of light-years from Velsus. I would never see my home again, not that there was anything left to see. And if I refuse? The tech, priests' optical units flared briefly brighter. Refusal is not an option available to you. Your survival was a resource expenditure that must be justified through continued utility. I closed my eyes, too exhausted to avoid, argue, In truth, I had no desire to remain on Velsis or its orbital platforms, surrounded by the ghosts of everything I had lost. Perhaps on Mars, among the emotionless tech priests and their incomprehensible machines, I might find a kind of peace, or at least purpose. There is one additional matter, the tech priest said, its voice modulating to a slightly different tone. A message was recovered from the control dais in the dock complex. It was addressed to you specifically. My eyes snapped open. From whom? Engin-Sier-Drave. It was recorded moments before the overload reached critical mass. The tech priest activated a small vox unit built into its wrist. Drave's voice emerged, distorted by static but recognizable. Malrek, if you survive, remember this. What happened on Velsus was a test case. The great rift has opened across the galaxy. Countless worlds face what we faced. Some will fall, some will stand. Faith alone is insufficient. Knowledge alone is insufficient. Only through both, applied with purpose and sacrifice, can humanity endure. The light returns to those who create it for themselves. Ave Imperator. Ave Omnisaya. The message ended, leaving only the soft clicking of machinery in the silence that followed. I reached out with trembling fingers, and after a moment's consideration, the tech priest placed St. Drusilla's medallion in my palm. I clutched it tightly, feeling its weight, its solidity, its strange power that had preserved me when all else was lost. Drave was right. The Astronomican had failed us. The Emperor's light had gone out. but humans had created new light, fashioned from technology and desperation and sacrifice. Hala with her knowledge of the dock systems, Drave with his tech rituals, Linear with her quiet strength and the medallion that had saved me, Even Thade, in his madness, had sought to create a new reality when the old one failed. The Great Rift had split the galaxy in two, separating humanity from its divine protector, exposing us to horrors beyond comprehension. But perhaps that was not the end. Perhaps it was a beginning, a dark and terrible birth of something new, a humanity that saved itself rather than waiting for salvation from above. As the tech priests prepared me for transfer to the Ironhands vessel, I held tight to that thought, and to the medallion that connected me to Linear, to all that I had lost, to all that might yet be found. The light returns to those who create it for themselves. In the darkness between stars, as Velsus receded behind me, and Mars waited somewhere in the unimaginable distance ahead, I swore to remember, to bear witness. to tell the story of what happens to civilians when the galaxy breaks, when the institutions they trusted abandon them, when the light goes out. This is that story. My testimony. My warning. The light of the Astronomican may return someday. The Emperor's gaze may once again fall upon the forgotten worlds of his Imperium, but until then, we must create our own light in the darkness. We must remember those who fell so that others might live, I am Jorun Malrek, once a dockworker of Velsis. Now I am the last witness to its fall. The tech priests of Mars study the medallion that saved me, seeking to understand its properties, to replicate its effects. They study me as well, probing my memories of the warp breach, the momentary glimpse into realms beyond reality. I cooperate, for what choice do I have? But in my dreams, I still see Vel Primaris as it was before the sky broke, the bustling markets, the glowing basilica, Linnea's smile in the soft light of our HAB unit. Dreams are dangerous things in the age of the Great Rift. The veil between reality and the warp is thin, and nightmares can become manifest with terrible ease. But I cling to these memories nonetheless. They are all that remains of a world now lost to madness and flame. Sometimes, in the quiet hours between the endless tests and examinations, I wonder about other worlds, other cities. Other ordinary people caught in the collapse of everything they knew. Did they find their own hyaeas and draves, leaders who chose to fight rather than surrender? Did they discover unexpected strengths within themselves, reserves of courage and resilience they never knew they possessed? Did some of them survive as I did, through chance or providence or some combination of both? I will never know their stories, just as they will never know mine. We are separated by the void, by the great rift, by the fundamental brokenness of an imperium too vast to comprehend its own suffering. But we are united in that suffering, in that struggle to create light where none remains. The tech priests tell me that Velsus is quarantined now, declared Perdita by order of the Inquisition. No ships will land there. No colonists will attempt to rebuild. whatever corruption tharday's ritual unleashed whatever taint the warp breach left behind it will remain contained on that blighted world until the stars themselves burn out i try to feel grief for this final death of my home but i find i cannot The Velsus I knew died the moment the sky broke. What remains is only a corpse, best left undisturbed. My true grief is reserved for the people, for Linnea, whose final gift saved my life at the cost of her own, for Heila, who stood against the impossible with nothing but courage and a failing shock maul, for Drave, who turned his faith in the Omnisiah into humanity's last defense, Even for Carrick, my old overseer, who recognized the coming storm before any of us and faced it with grim resignation born of experience, they deserved better than abandonment, better than a desperate last stand in the darkness beneath a dying city, better than to be forgotten by the imperium they served faithfully all their lives. So I remember them." I speak their names to the unfeeling recording devices of the Mechanicus. I insist that their sacrifice be noted in whatever records survive this. Fractured Age. It is a small defiance, meaningless in the grand scheme of a galaxy at war with itself. but it is mine. And sometimes, when the red light of Mars filters through the narrow windows of my cell-like quarters, I take out St. Drusilla's medallion, now returned to me after extensive study, and I hold it to the light. The tarnished silver catches the crimson glow, transforming it into something almost golden, almost like the light of the distant Astronomican, as it once shone through the stained glass of the basilica. In those moments, I can almost believe that the Emperor still watches over humanity. That despite the Great Rift, despite the darkness that has swallowed half the galaxy, there is still purpose to our suffering. Still meaning in our sacrifice, almost, but not quite. Faith, like hope, requires nurturing to survive. Mine withered in the ashes of Velprimeris, in the screams of the dying astropaths, in the mad light of Thade's eyes as he tore reality apart in the emperor's name. What remains is simpler, harder. The knowledge that humanity stands alone against the dark, That no divine intervention will save us from ourselves, or from the horrors that lurk between the stars. That when the light goes out, we must kindle our own flames, however small, however brief. It is not a comforting truth, but it is truth nonetheless. And in an age of madness and lies, truth itself becomes a form of resistance. A tiny light in overwhelming darkness. I am Jorun Malrek, survivor of Velsis, witness to the breaking of the world. I carry the light of memory through the long night of the Great Rift. It is not enough. It will never be enough. But it is all I have to give.
